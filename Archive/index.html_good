Despite widespread agreement on the importance of localization in the humanitarian system, local communities are often unequipped to adequately address flood and drought hazards, leading to a loss of lives and livelihoods, financial costs to the broader humanitarian system, and reduced resilience and early recovery. This APP considers three policy approaches that local communities can use to address flood and drought risks: traditional humanitarian response, anticipatory action (AA), and disaster risk management (DRM). Using the criteria of technical feasibility, political feasibility, cost-benefit ratio, timeliness, and equity, I recommend that IMPACT Initiatives and its partners (1) prioritize DRM where it is politically feasible; (2) reallocate resources towards AA where DRM is not politically feasible and AA is technically feasible; and (3) focus on traditional r", "instructor": "Andrew Pennock", "client_org_type": "", "problem_level": "Cross Border", "geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project": "International"}, {"title": "Pathways to Success: Improving the Transparency of Student Outcomes in the Virginia Community College System", "summary": "Pathways to Success: Improving the Transparency of Student Outcomes in the Virginia Community College System — \"Also contact with Catherine Finnegan \t434-243-5419\"", "instructor": "Leora Friedberg", "client_org_type": "", "problem_level": "State/Province", "geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project": "Domestic"}, {"title": "Pathways to Success: Improving the Transparency of Student Outcomes in the Virginia Community College System", "summary": "Pathways to Success: Improving the Transparency of Student Outcomes in the Virginia Community College System — \"Also contact with Catherine Finnegan \t434-243-5419\"", "instructor": "Leora Friedberg", "client_org_type": "", "problem_level": "State/Province", "geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project": "Domestic"}, {"title": "Reducing Unnecessary Separation of Children from Domestic Abuse Survivors", "summary": "Reducing Unnecessary Separation of Children from Domestic Abuse Survivors — In child neglect cases, unnecessary separations from non-offending parents in abusive partnerships have intensely damaging and long-lasting consequences for children.

Based on a review of the literature, policy context, and stakeholder interviews, this report evaluates four alternative strategies that Virginia DSS might pursue to reduce displacement among high-acuity foster youth. This analysis reveals that decreasing the barrier crime list presents the most promising path forward. By combining systemic reform with existing supports, York/Poquoson DSS can help ensure that more high-acuity foster youth are placed in a stable, nurturing environments—breaking the cycle of displacement and laying the foundation for long-term well-being and", "instructor": "Anna Rorem", "client_org_type": "Local Government", "problem_level": "City/Municipal", "geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project": "Domestic"}, {"title": "Improving Employment Outcomes for Individuals in Treatment of Substance Use Disorder", "summary": "Improving Employment Outcomes for Individuals in Treatment of Substance Use Disorder — In rural regions like Dickenson County, the economic costs of substance use disorder (SUD) are not just abstract statistics; they manifest in lost job opportunities, cycles of poverty, and the lack of access to vital recovery supports.

This research report evaluates three evidence-informed interventions that aim to improve employment outcomes for individuals undergoing substance abuse treatment (SAT) at the soon-to-be-established Wildwood Recovery Center in Dickenson County.

With the OASI trust fund projected to deplete in just 8 years, the financial security of over 50 million retirees is at stake.

Without intervention, Sunflower third-graders—who are predominantly Black and socio-economically disadvantaged—risk falling further behind their peers across Mississippi and the country. Following a robust analysis, this technical report recommends that Sunflower pilot Out-of-School Time (OST) tutoring in the 2026-2027 academic year. This policy alternative ensures the highest academic gain, leverages existing resources, maintains strong stakeholder buy-in, and incurs the least total financial expenditures. With thoughtful implementation, OST tutoring represents the most practical strategy for improving third-grade math proficiency in Sunflower.
