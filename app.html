Rising farm debt and troubling economic agricultural conditions construct the case for policy action to assist these smaller sized farms who experience magnified effects of supply-chain disruption. Seeking an addressable and actionable policy opportunity, Market Makers, a buyer to seller connection platform, is primarily centered on. This platform, created in partnership with the Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, retains the potential to help ameliorate some of the information and market issues faced by smaller farm operations (Virginia Market Maker, 2022). Yet, this platform is crippled by rampant underutilization. After exploring several alternatives, using three comparative criteria, Effectiveness, Cost, and Administrative Feasibility, an Automatic Opt-in policy option is selected as the best course of action.\r\n","instructor":"Gerard Robinson","client_org_type":"State Government","problem_level":"State/Province","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"A Permanent Solution to a Temporary Policy","summary":"Temporary Protected Status (TPS) provides temporary protection from deportation for individuals whose home country is unsafe.

The change in the Adverse Effect Wage Rate leads to H-2A Visa workers receiving higher wages than domestic farm workers. Higher wages increases the cost of the program, impacting who will use the program. Requiring farmers pay H-2A workers a minimum wage equal to the average of occupational wages is recommended to reduce the impact on farms and simultaneously provide equitable wages to H-2A workers. ","instructor":"Anna Rorem","client_org_type":"Federal Government","problem_level":"National","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Retaining & Reintegrating the IT Army of Ukraine","summary":"Immediately following Russia’s invasion in February 2022, the Ukrainian government became the first nation-state to actively call upon global hackers to join its defensive and offensive military operations (Karagiannopoulos, 2023). Known as the IT Army of Ukraine, this loosely affiliated hacker group has quickly pioneered a new vision for cyberwarfare and cyber defense due to its success in the current conflict. Despite its success, the IT Army’s current structure and methods of operation blur the line between combatants and civilians, posing a threat to public safety. Moving forward, it is imperative to provide the Ukrainian government with formal avenues to retain and reintegrate the IT Army that simultaneously enable its members to continue to test and enhance their skillsets absent a threat to the general public.\r\n\r\nThis analysis will draw parallels from successful demobilization and reintegration strategies to provide IT Army members with effective public and private sector pathways for cyber skill retainment. Ensuring that the retainment and reintegration of IT Army members will enhance the defensive cyber capabilities of Ukraine requires an evaluation of five policy alternatives:\r\n\r\n1. Establish a Ukrainian Cyber Reserve\r\n\r\n2. Private Sector Ethical Hacking – Penetration Testing\r\n\r\n3. Private Sector Ethical Hacking – Red Team Operations\r\n\r\n4.

In response TARII is organizing an international workshop to study the trade in illegally removed archaeological artifacts from countries in the eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia. The study will focus on the trade and smuggling networks by which such artifacts are looted from the ground, are smuggled out of the countries of origin, are passed through the network of intermediate market countries, and then surface in destination market countries. The research would then be utilized to coordinate conversations among different countries so that each can learn from the other about the illegal trade, losses to cultural heritage, and establish mechanisms for disrupting the trade of artifacts in efforts to preserve archaeological and cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nPotential Solutions\r\n\r\nTo address the issue of theft, trafficking, and destruction of cultural and archaeological heritage, TARII could recommend the following:\r\n\r\n1. Spearhead the creation of a new International Convention or Agreement.\r\n\r\n2. Encourage the adoption of a new International Declaration that calls for individual country implementation and enforcement.\r\n\r\n3.

While spearheading the creation of a new international convention or agreement rated well within innovation and effectiveness it had low feasibility and impact prospects. Encouraging the adoption of a new international declaration rated high for innovation for the perceived opportunities but rated low in feasibility, impact and effectiveness due to ever changing political relationships and increasing conflict zones. Based on this evaluation of the alternatives, the best course of action would be for TARII to contribute to an internationally accessible artifact database and collaborate with inter-governmental organizations that will investigate and prosecute illicit actors. TARII should pursue the planned workshop with the added intention of inviting participating states to come together to establish a task force within INTERPOL that will work to address the issues of theft, trafficking, and destruction of cultural heritage.","instructor":"Craig Volden","client_org_type":"Research Institute or Think Tank","problem_level":"National","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"International"},{"title":"Addressing High Teacher Turnover Rates in Virginia Child Care Centers","summary":"In Virginia's subsidized child care centers, high turnover rates among lead and assistant teachers jeopardize stable, high-quality teacher-child relationships, which are crucial for positive student outcomes.

Thus, critical \r\nbarriers in the intersection between digital literacy and affordability stand in the way of \r\nclosing this digital divide for low-income Americans. The Nonprofit Technology Enterprise \r\nNetwork (NTEN) and other entities within the digital inclusion space are working towards \r\nclosing this digital divide – with NTEN's Digital Inclusion Fellowship addressing \r\naffordability and prioritizing digital literacy.

Data use is considered a key component of decision-making at the school division-level, especially as it plays a key part in determining academic plans and goals in the education sphere. However, the challenge of adapting to new technological transitions to improve customer service has placed burdens on a central office not yet equipped to fully embrace these modern changes. This poses a challenge as to how data use can be increasingly incorporated into Central Office so it can serve schools to its full capacity.\r\n\r\nInability to address the lack of data use within Central Office has repercussions in its ability to service schools effectively and provide resources for efficient decision-making. Ultimately, RPS Central Office can improve upon its current data-use culture by providing more technological support to better prepare their end users for adoption and implementation. Additionally, insufficient Talent Office exit data collection for human resources management and the lack of standardized upkeep of archival data for all offices poses concerns to the division’s goals for Strategic Priority 5: Modern Systems and Infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis report identifies three alternatives supported by qualitative and quantitative evidence that aim to foster data use within the Central Office by targeting varying levels of end users:\r\n\r\n1.

Currently, teachers that work at participating schools receive a $10,000 participation bonus and could receive an additional $5,000 bonus if students’ scores on standardized tests improve significantly over the course of the year. The division has approved the continuation of the pilot program in both schools and its expansion to at least two others. However, continuing to offer these bonuses may be unsustainable. If the division cannot adequately compensate teachers for participating, it may not have enough teachers to continue RPS200 in future years.\r\n\r\nI analyzed four alternative compensation plans the division could pursue: these are maintaining the current bonus structure, partnering with small businesses in Richmond to offer teachers special deals, offering bi-weekly activities to students that would shorten the school day for teachers, and assisting teachers with student loan payments. For each of the alternatives, I assessed cost effectiveness, measuring how the policy would impact teacher retention and improve student achievement. I also analyzed the political and administrative feasibility for each policy option. This analysis led me to conclude that partnering with small businesses to offer teachers special deals in conjunction with offering small participation bonuses is the best course of action for the division. This recommendation is the most cost effective at improving teacher retention, the second most cost effective for improving student achievement, and the most politically feasible option. While it could be administratively challenging, hiring two additional people to manage the small-business partnerships and market the program will make it easier to implement. Lastly, removing bonuses entirely may be detrimental to teacher satisfaction, especially among teachers already participating in the pilot. Consequently, the division should continue offering small bonuses for participation.","instructor":"Noah Myung","client_org_type":"Local Government","problem_level":"City/Municipal","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Building Bridges with Indigenous Communities ","summary":"For centuries, Indigenous communities have been subjected to religiously motivated violence. Despite recent global efforts aimed at addressing religiously motivated violence, Indigenous communities struggle to be included in these endeavors.\r\n\r\nThroughout history and to the modern day, Indigenous communities across all regions of the world confront the reality of religiously motivated violence (RMV). From hate speech growing into mass genocide, Indigenous people bring a firsthand understanding of the consequences that RMV can bring upon the well-being of societies. Their perspectives hold influence in combatting RMV, yet they have faced challenges in both initial engagements and maintaining involvement in the work.\r\n\r\nThe problem of addressing religiously motivated violence requires collaboration among diverse stakeholders, each with their own unique solutions. The United Religions Initiative has been at the forefront of uniting these stakeholders into a multilateral coalition dedicated to collectively eradicating religious violence through the United Nations. With this, URI is conscious of the importance of integrating indigenous voices in their efforts for violence prevention, yet they have faced challenges in achieving this inclusion.\r\n\r\nThis document serves as a comprehensive review of a year’s work I have conducted, studying the imperative task of integrating Indigenous communities into initiatives aimed at ending religiously motivated violence. The document unfolds with an encompassing background section, followed by evidence-based research on solutions that have been done to include Indigenous voices in violence initiatives and non-violence initiatives. By examining the silent struggles faced by indigenous communities, light is shed on the profound impact that their voices can have in shaping effective and inclusive strategies for addressing religious violence. Then, I will be proposing three alternatives for the United Religions Initiative to pursue in integrating Indigenous voices in their programs. My three proposed alternatives are Regional Representative Bodies, United Nation Partnerships, and Increasing Indigenous Representation. All of these alternatives are proposed within a 10-year time frame. These alternatives will be evaluated based on the five criteria points of inclusivity, social feasibility, sustainability, non-material cost, and material costs. Finding that the Increasing Indigenous Representation alternative ranks the best on 3 out of 5 criteria points, I will recommend that Increasing Indigenous Staff in URI is the best course of action for URI to adopt.

Currently the United States, has a higher incarceration rate than any other country in the world (Equal Justice Initiative, 2020). The criminal justice system is impacted by a variety of factors including race, class, and gender in ways that create an inequitable system for some individuals. The negative consequences are felt heavily among individuals who find themselves impacted by mental health issues, financial struggles, and prior history with the criminal justice system. Mitigation and mitigation specialists work to reduce the inequities that exist within the criminal justice system, by placing a spotlight on those factors that introduce an individual to the criminal justice system.\r\n\r\nOn February 14, 2018, Nikolas Cruz walked into Parkland High School where he proceeded to shoot thirty-four people, killing seventeen of them (Levenson et al., 2022). For many there was very little question about the factor of guilt or innocence. The question surrounded whether the death penalty should be imposed in this case. Jurors would go on to hear about Mr. Cruz’s troubled upbringing marred by abuse and having been exposed to heavy drinking while his mother was pregnant with him (Levenson et al., 2022). These mitigating factors resulted in the jury opting to sentence Mr. Cruz to life imprisonment (Levenson et al., 2022). These mitigating factors were collected and compiled through the work of his mitigation specialist, Kate O’Shea. The work done in this case is not dissimilar to what is done throughout the country by mitigation specialists. They are trained and skilled in showing that a defendant should not be judged solely from what may have been the worst day of their life. They show the tons of factors that went into a singular incident: their mental health, upbringing, the neighborhood they grew up, history of abuse. Without the work of a mitigation specialist, they jury may never get the opportunity to hear how those factors impacted that individual on the day of their accused crime. In cases in which an individual is facing the death penalty, being able to provide mitigating factors is a Supreme Court recognized right that an individual has. As more and more states begin to abolish the death penalty and replace it with mandatory minimums of life sentences attention should be given to expanding the use of mitigation and mitigation specialists outside of simply being used in capital defense cases. With the Commonwealth of Virginia banning the death penalty in 2018, the focus of mitigation was able to spread more broadly across all areas of criminal defense.\r\n\r\nVirginia’s indigent defense offices are uniquely positioned on this issue, as every public defender’s office within the Commonwealth have at least one mitigation specialist. This Applied Policy Project is focused on increasing equity in the criminal justice system through mitigation. In this paper I first will provide a background on the history of mitigation and mitigation specialist, why the work is necessary and increasing the field of mitigation is an important policy problem and provide background on the current policy area while providing existing evidence to support proposed policy options. Based upon this analysis, three policy options will be considered focusing on increasing the field of mitigation: (1) Creating a mitigation certificate program, (2) Identifying and utilizing a Department of Education Experimental Site opportunity, and (3) a Formal mentoring program to the field of mitigation. After the consideration of these policy alternatives and examining them against the selected criteria, alternative (2) Identifying and utilizing a Department of Education Experimental Site opportunity - will be presented as the final recommendation, concluding with a plan for implementation.","instructor":"Gerard Robinson","client_org_type":"State Government","problem_level":"State/Province","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Opportunities to Improve the Effectiveness of Task Force Koa Moana, Analysis and Recommendations for Marine Force Pacific","summary":"Despite US Indo-Pacific Command’s (INDOPACOM) understanding of the importance of US-Pacific Island relations, the existing task force planning and execution practices within MARFORPAC and I MEF limit the long-term effectiveness of Task Force Koa Moana’s relationship-building efforts. Failure to adjust these practices to better align with the US Marine Corps’ comparative advantage and US regional strategy risks limiting the development of deeper US Pacific Island relationships. These relationships are vital to US and allied security in the Indo-Pacific and need to be strengthened. To address this issue, the study first engaged in a substantive research task focused on identifying existing limitations and areas of improvement. Through a combination of an academic literature review, case studies, and semi-structured interviews, it identified three primary challenges for the task force: (1) the need for better integration with broader defense strategy and non-defense US engagement in the region, (2) the need to incorporate mechanisms or processes to evaluate the short-term and long-term effectiveness of Koa Moana’s annual activities, and (3) the need to reduce the continued militarized of US engagement with partner countries. The study then developed and analyzed five policy options designed to address these issues. These five options include: (1) integrate Koa Moana planning efforts with the embassy interagency planning process, (2) connect Koa Moana’s annual activities to a regional partner engagement strategy, (3) develop an assessment, monitoring, and evaluation (AM&E) plan, (4) narrow the focus of Koa Moana’s activities to traditional security cooperation activities, and (5) include Pacific stakeholders in planning efforts.\r\n\r\nUsing the evaluative criteria of political feasibility, administrative feasibility, a two-pronged assessment of effectiveness, and cost, this study recommends that MARFORPAC implement policy options 1, 2, 3, and 5. All four options score high on both effectiveness prongs and score high on at least one of two feasibility measures. While in theory, option 4 appears well poised to address key aspects of the three primary challenges, the study analysis indicates that it is likely to increase adversary influence in the Pacific Islands and create significant gaps in US engagement with the Pacific. As a result, it becomes even more important to pursue the four other options. The combination of these options contributes to more effective bilateral relationship building over the long-term and can help stop or at least reduce the further militarization of US partner engagement.","instructor":"Noah Myung","client_org_type":"Federal Government","problem_level":"Cross Border","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"International"},{"title":"Increasing Walkability & Bikeability in the City of Charlottesville ","summary":"Charlottesville, Virginia, has inadequate active transport infrastructure, creating a vehicle-centric approach to transportation, which increases traffic congestion and concerns about safety among citizens who would otherwise consider biking or walking.

This applied policy project seeks to address some of the root causes of America’s high population of incarcerated individuals and provide three alternatives to address the problem.\r\n\r\nAmerica has the highest incarceration rate in the world, and at any given time has around 1.2 million individuals in jail or prison. Spending time in jail leads to poor outcomes later in life, including worse employment prospects for men, less earnings over a lifetime, and lasting psychological impacts that cannot be quantified. Individuals who enter jail or prison are not likely to continue receiving whatever care they previously had access to, since jails and prisons tend to have severely underfunded health services, particularly for people who require mental health services.\r\n\r\nJail diversion allows mentally ill individuals that have committed non-violent crimes to be diverted from jail and instead receive the treatment and support they need. Jail diversion can occur at various stages through a person’s interactions with the criminal justice system. The goal is to divert people away from jail in the earlier stages, and possibly even before they encounter a police officer or get arrested.\r\n\r\nThe three alternatives are:\r\n\r\n1. Crisis In Training (CIT): a police-based specialized training teaching police officers how to handle high-stress encounters with individuals experiencing a mental health crisis;\r\n\r\n2. Community Mental Health Programs, specifically “Warm Lines:” a newer form of a help line that seek to fill a gap in mental health services and are usually staffed by peer volunteers, not to be used in crisis or emergency situations;\r\n\r\n3. Mental Health Courts: although they are considered a newer form of jail diversion, mental health courts have generally proved be quite effective at diverting individuals away from jail in exchange for a commitment to abide by a court-ordered treatment plan or program\r\n\r\nI used four evaluative criteria to judge the alternatives: cost, political feasibility, administrative feasibility, and equity. Oregon currently has a tense atmosphere due to essentially reversing a bill that largely decriminalized possession of a small amount of drugs. Based on that and the various criteria mentioned, I recommend that OHA pursue CIT for police officers at the county level. CIT is a renowned approach to jail diversion that is proven to be effective at reducing arrests and making officers feel safer when dealing with mentally ill individuals. Although it will require police training which takes police officers away from their normal duties, it is low-cost especially compared to mental health courts. CIT is also already present in Oregon across various counties, which makes it easier to significantly expand the program in counties that it already exists in, and bring it to counties that are completely new to CIT.","instructor":"Gerard Robinson","client_org_type":"State Government","problem_level":"State/Province","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Cosmic Conduct: Constructing a Framework for Responsible Space Behavior","summary":"This project explores ways to establish a definition of responsible behavior in space by the US establishing its own criteria.

This technical report addresses chronic absenteeism that is caused by housing insecurity faced by RPS students. The\r\n\r\nreport gives a brief background on how chronic absenteeism affects school systems across the United States then delves deeper into how the problem is affecting RPS. Political, geographic, and systemic factors deepen this issue, with rise in absentee rates linked to economic disparity, gentrification, and transportation challenges. High chronic absenteeism not only threatens students’ academic achievement but also risks schools losing accreditation, highlighting the need for specially targeted solutions to address the interconnected issues of housing insecurity and educational access.\r\n\r\nThe literature review portion of the technical report explores evidence-based solutions to tackle chronic absenteeism, focusing on alternative transportation methods and community engagement strategies. Public transit partnerships, ridesharing programs, and optimized bus routing policies show promise in approaches to improve school attendance among transient students. Furthermore, strong community engagement efforts are essential for the effective implementation of federal policies like the McKinney-Vento Act, ensuring that housing-insecure students receive the necessary support they deserve. The literature highlights the importance of a multifaceted approach, combining transportation solutions with active community involvement to address the systemic barriers that hinder students' access to education.\r\n\r\nFollowing the review of evidence-based approaches three policy alternatives are proposed to address chronic absenteeism due to housing insecurity; 1) Utilizing HopSkipDrive, a ridesharing service for safe and efficient student transportation; 2) Establishing a Housing Stability Taskforce within RPS to support McKinney-Vento students and 3) Reconfiguring Bus Routing Technology to enhance transportation reliability. Each alternative is evaluated based on political feasibility, administrative effectiveness, equity, and cost. After assessing these policy alternatives based on the following criteria the recommendation is to integrate HopSkipDrive, given its practicality, affordability, and potential to show quick results in improving school attendance among students facing housing insecurity. This recommendation includes a comprehensive implementation plan that provides detailed steps on how to ensure smooth roll out of this system.","instructor":"Gerard Robinson","client_org_type":"Local Government","problem_level":"City/Municipal","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Analysis of the Military Spouse Unemployment Rate","summary":"Active duty military spouses face a 22% unemployment rate, compared to the 3.9% civilian unemployment rate.

The low levels of financial inclusion in\r\nParaguay are apparent in the predominant use of cash and the low percentage of adults with an\r\naccount in a formal banking institution (Del Valle & Carrasco, 2022). Only roughly 50% of the\r\nadult population holds a bank account in a formal institution, with young adults aged 18-35 being\r\namong the excluded (Gómez Rojas, 2023). The high percentage of unbanked adults can\r\ngenerally be explained through three main areas: lack of access, poor financial literacy, and\r\ndominance of the informal economy. Access constraints are not a significant issue in Paraguay,\r\nas there are bank branches located throughout the nation and the most reported reasons for not\r\nhaving a bank account involve “having no need for it,” “lack of money,” or “documentation\r\nissues.” However, low levels of financial literacy persist in Paraguay, as only 10% of adults\r\nreport having received education on managing finances (ENIF, 2013). The dominance of the\r\ninformal sector is also apparent in Paraguay, with cash being the primary form of payment,\r\naccounting for over 76% of employee salaries (“Estrategia Nacional,” n.d.). This reliance on\r\ncash presents economic inefficiencies and safety risks, such as vulnerability to robbery.\r\nIncreasing formal banking uptake and usage is crucial, as it is correlated with various positive\r\noutcomes, including enhanced savings (Breza et al., 2020; Blumenstock et al., 2018), a decrease\r\nin crime rates (Wright et al., 2017), more streamlined wage payments (Dusza, 2016), reduced\r\nfraud and administrative inefficiencies (Muralidharan et al., 2016), heightened female workforce\r\nparticipation (Field et al., 2021), and improved crop yields for farmers (Lasse et al., 2016).\r\nMoreover, the utilization of formal financial services holds significant implications for account\r\nholders’ resilience to adverse economic shocks by facilitating savings (Pomeranz and Kast,\r\n2022) and allowing individuals to easily share both money and risk with others (Riley, 2018;\r\nJack and Suri, 2014). This paper’s final recommendation is to pursue a BCP-Private Sector Partnership to persuade major employers to pay salaries/wages through direct deposits rather than cash. Analysis suggests this alternative will increase bank account ownership by 12.5 percentage points and usage in terms of increased savings by 5 percentage points at a low cost that is administratively feasible for the Central Bank to undertake.\r\n","instructor":"Noah Myung","client_org_type":"International Government","problem_level":"National","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"International"},{"title":"Coal Ash: Charting the Future for a Byproduct from Virginia's Past","summary":"Electricity generated from coal produces coal ash as a byproduct.

In recent years, public support for government action has grown, and the city is now prioritizing affordable housing development through a zoning ordinance rewrite. The new zoning ordinance is intended to reverse previous inequitable housing policies that have historically prioritized single-family zoning, which is typically more expensive than multifamily housing. The University of Virginia has also committed to developing affordable housing through three ground lease agreements with potential developers, lowering the overall cost to developers by removing the cost of land. One site, the 2-acre land parcel at 10th and Wertland street, is in a predominantly Black neighborhood, necessitating caution on the part of developers and City officials, as any new development should not jeopardize the well-being of long-term residents in the 10th and Page neighborhood.\r\n\r\nCommon land practices for creating affordable housing include zoning, establishing land banks, and establishing community land trusts. As previously stated, Charlottesville is currently revising its zoning codes, and given the limited scope of this report on one development site, land banks or community land trusts are not viable policy options. As a result, this report evaluates three approaches to increasing the number of affordable housing units based on housing policy literature. These three policy alternatives will be evaluated based on their effectiveness (60%) in creating affordable housing units, timeline (20%) of months required from implementation to construction development, and administrative feasibility (20%) to determine how practical the alternative is for the City of Charlottesville and the developer. The policy alternatives are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Policy Alternative 1: Maintaining the status quo\r\n2. Policy alternative 2: Modifying the zoning of the land parcel through a\r\nrezoning request to the City Council\r\n3. Policy alternative 3: Modifying the zoning of the land parcel through a\r\nrezoning request to the City Council and utilizing the Charlottesville Affordable Housing Fund (CAHF)\r\n\r\nThis report recommends that The City of Charlottesville should increase the number of affordable rental units at the 10th and Wertland Street site by granting zoning changes and allocating funds from the Charlottesville Affordable Housing Fund. Alternative 3 is the most promising option due to its ability to create the most affordable housing units while lowering development costs. Finally, this report will conclude with discussions about other methods of incentivizing developers to build affordable housing, such as lowering parking minimums and utilizing federal and state housing subsidies.","instructor":"Craig Volden","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"City/Municipal","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Evaluating Emergency Rental Assistance During Covid-19: A Strategy to Mitigate Eviction Outcomes in Future National Crisis","summary":"This report aims to synthesize qualitative evidence with quantitative conclusions to determine which factors relevant to Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) implementation best predict eviction rates.

Network adequacy refers to the sufficiency and accessibility of healthcare providers, facilities, and services within a health insurance plan's network to meet the healthcare needs of its enrollees. The principle of network adequacy is fundamental because it guarantees that people with health insurance can access the care they require when they need it, free from obstacles like long wait times, extensive travel distances, or expensive out-of-network fees. The lack of mental health providers in insurance plan networks, particularly in certain geographic regions or for specific specialty treatments, is one of the major obstacles to receiving mental healthcare. This can result in long wait periods for appointments and trouble locating a mental health physician that accepts a certain insurance plan. Furthermore, some insurance plans may impose restrictions on the number of visits or types of treatment covered for mental health services or require prior authorization, which can make it more challenging for people to obtain the care they require. Addressing these access barriers is crucially important to promote health equity and make progress toward better health outcomes in the United States.","instructor":"Craig Volden","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"National","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Investigating Strategies for Greater Inclusion and Fairness","summary":"This report reviews the current equity programs that the Thomas Jefferson Planning District Commission perform and offer policy alternatives on how the organization can create more equitable policies in the future.","instructor":"Craig Volden","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"City/Municipal","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Beyond Food: Addressing Food Insecurity through Food Pantry Interventions","summary":"Despite an increase in the amount of food and resources aimed at fighting food insecurity in the US, the prevalence of food insecurity has remained relatively unchanged for the past twenty years, putting the health, development, and normal growth of Americans at risk.This report investigates the current charitable food landscape in the US, traditional models of success at food banks and pantries, and what existing research tells us about how to best address food insecurity.

Historical discrimination, including redlining, sub-prime loans and predatory lending leading up to the 2008 housing crisis, and current zoning regulations have compounded the disadvantage Black residents in the City face. Not only this, but rapid population growth, stagnant development, and depressed wages has made homeownership unaffordable for residents making less than 170 percent of the AMI, or about $93,500 a year (DP05, 2021; Homebuying Calculator, 2023; Appendix III). Among Black residents, the median income is about $36,749, putting the prospect of homeownership out of reach for most (S1903, 2021).\r\n\r\nThe inability to afford a home has direct costs, opportunity costs, and externalities for the City and its residents. Per-person, homelessness costs the City about $30,000-50,000, those who are unable to afford living in the city lose valuable work time, commuting up to 90 minutes to and from work (Data USA, 2020). Commuting also has environmental impacts, creating about 600 tons of carbon dioxide each day, and living in the suburban area leads to lost tax-revenues for the City (Ihlanfeldt &amp; Yang, 2021; Finance, 2021). The following analysis seeks to address low rates of Black homeownership in the City and its associated costs. To solve this challenge, I present three policy alternatives:\r\n\r\n1.Increase Conveyance to Richmond Land Bank of the Maggie Walker Community Land Trust\r\n2.Increase Down Payment Assistance Programs \r\n3.Rezoning to Increase the Affordable Housing Stock\r\n\r\nEach alternative was evaluated on four criteria: Cost, Cost Effectiveness, Equity Impact, and Political Feasibility. Ultimately, I recommend both increasing funding for the down payment assistance program and implementing the proposed zoning policy changes. Increasing funding for the down payment assistance program would create about 487 new homeownership opportunities, would most effectively increase equity, and is relatively cost- effective.\r\n\r\nHowever, increasing the down payment assistance program alone will not solve the housing challenges faced by the City of Richmond. Therefore, the City should also implement new zoning which eliminates parking space minimums, permits accessory dwelling units, and revises short-term rental regulations. This alternative will bring in revenue to the City and is politically feasible as it is in the legislative stage of the Legislative Process. In this stage, City of Richmond?s Department of Planning and Development Review drafts the zoning change Ordinances and follows the legislative process to adopt the ordinances (City-Initiated Zoning Changes, 2022).","instructor":"Craig Volden","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"City/Municipal","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"How to Stay: Addressing the Challenges of Humanitarian Remote Management in Myanmar through Localization","summary":"This report reviews the humanitarian challenges of remote management operational modalities currently in use by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Myanmar as a result of protracted access constraints for international staff.

This report aimed to provide actionable solutions to tackle the issue and was commissioned by Liliya Emmet, the supervisor of the Central Resources Division (CRD). Several factors contribute to the escalating turnover rate, including the hiring freeze, an aging workforce, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The report identifies several policy alternatives proposed or implemented in different agencies to address the problem.\r\nThese alternatives aim to reduce the cost of turnover while enhancing productivity and reducing employee burnout. The report evaluates the alternatives based on cost, effectiveness, and administrative feasibility and considers the following options:\r\n1. Status Quo: Increase the number of part-time employees from 2024 through 2028.\r\n2. Succession Planning: Implement Succession Planning throughout the office to ensure a\r\nsmooth transition and lower the time a position is vacant.\r\n3. Centralization of Knowledge Management: Create a standardized practice for collecting\r\ninstitutional knowledge utilizing the FMS&#39;s internal database across all three divisions.\r\nAfter careful analysis, the report recommends Succession Planning as the best approach for FMS. This alternative allows FMS to plan for turnovers by having employees backfill into positions, mitigating vacancy time, and enabling FMS to train employees for future positions. This approach enhances productivity and ensures that employees continuously learn, thereby reducing the negative impact of turnover on the FMS office.","instructor":"Chris Ruhm","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"National","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Improving Team One Love Clubs on College Campuses","summary":"Team One Love Clubs work to educate students, but the One Love Foundation is struggling to have a cohesive and equally effective clubs across college campuses.

Payday loans are typically unaffordable to those who use them. The average payday loan repayment amount is $430 on the next payday, which amounts to 36% of an average borrower?s gross paycheck. The problem is that most borrowers can only afford no more than 5% while still having to fund their basic expenses. Habitat for Humanity of Greater Charlottesville has found this problem amongst the families they serve in that there are individuals who have unaffordable debt as a result of payday loan usage. Habitat has the goal of reducing payday loan use among the families they serve, so more families can meet the minimum credit score requirement needed to be considered eligible to receive an affordable home. After an extensive review of the existing literature and considering what Habitat has the resources and capability to do, I consider three alternatives to address the problem of frequent use of payday loans.

TDOs require law enforcement to retain custody of the individual in question and oversee their transportation to an appropriate treatment facility.  \r\n\r\nHowever, due to the state-wide shortage of behavioral health resources and increases in 911 calls with a mental health nexus, it is difficult for the Henrico County Police Division to locate available treatment facilities to accommodate individuals under TDO. First, the shortage of available treatment centers and mental health professionals in Virginia has led to increased wait times for individuals seeking treatment. My analysis demonstrates that the average wait time between the imposition of a TDO and placement in treatment is an estimated 33 hours. These substantial wait times are a costly and time-consuming burden. In total, the county spent $740,994 on overtime pay for TDO coverage in 2022. Further, long periods of custody take police officers off the road for an extended period of time while waiting for treatment facilities to become available. This results in a diminished capacity for the Henrico County Police Division to respond to situations in the community. \r\n\r\nExisting research shows that a well-established network of crisis stabilization centers can promote positive outcomes for individuals experiencing a behavioral health crisis. When these facilities are accessible, police departments can more efficiently transport individuals to receive the treatment they require. \r\nIn addition to letting present trends continue, this report examines two policy alternatives that Henrico County may adopt to place individuals experiencing a behavioral health crisis into high-quality, professional care as quickly as possible: \r\n1.\tEstablish a 23-hour crisis receiving center: a facility designed for short-term treatment and assessment to determine whether admission to an inpatient facility is necessary.\r\n2.\tEstablish a full continuum of care facility: a facility that includes a crisis receiving center and a crisis stabilization unit with beds for up to 15 days of in-patient treatment. \r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes of these policy options are evaluated against four criteria: average wait time, care capacity, five-year total cost, and administrative feasibility. These criteria were selected in accordance with the client?s requests. \r\n\r\nBased on the findings of this report, Henrico County should seek approval from the Board of Supervisors to establish a 16,000 square foot full continuum of care facility designed to meet the needs of individuals who experience mental health challenges.\"","instructor":"Chris Ruhm","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"City/Municipal","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Increasing Remote Patient Monitoring in the Veterans Health Administration","summary":"Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is a\r\ntype of digital healthcare that has been\r\nproven to be effective in managing\r\nchronic conditions by allowing patients\r\nto constantly monitor their health data\r\nand virtually communicate with their\r\ndoctors and care teams using specific\r\ndevices.

If every spot was filled and 76.1% were retained, 516 teachers were no longer employed as RPS teachers in fall 2022 which cost the division roughly $13.43M.\r\n\r\nTeachers are the most influential school-based factor for students&#39; academic achievement and life outcomes (Chetty et al., 2014; Goldhaber et al., 1999; Hanushek, 2011; Jackson, 2018; Opper, 2019; Rivkin et al., 2005; Rockoff, 2004). Accordingly, developing and maintaining a high-quality teacher labor force is vital for the future of education. Teachers not being retained, also called turnover, is a major barrier to this goal. Turnover is negatively associated with student achievement. school functioning, professional learning, and teacher morale (Guin, 2004; Jackson et al., 2009; Ronfeldt et al., 2013). Further, it costs districts thousands of dollars per teacher (Barnes et al., 2007; National Commission on Teaching &amp; America?s Future, 2007). Teachers? career decisions are influenced by many factors (i.e., see Grissom?s framework, 2011), yet only some can be affected by division decisions. Of RPS exit survey takers, 48% of respondents cited school context, 44% cited division context, and 23% cited compensation as one of their primary reasons for leaving RPS (Bishop, 2022b). These reasons are all potentially policy amenable and, thus, will be the focus of this report. I identified three policy approaches to approve teacher retention:\r\n1.

Despite widespread agreement on the importance of localization in the humanitarian system, local communities are often unequipped to adequately address flood and drought hazards, leading to a loss of lives and livelihoods, financial costs to the broader humanitarian system, and reduced resilience and early recovery. This APP considers three policy approaches that local communities can use to address flood and drought risks: traditional humanitarian response, anticipatory action (AA), and disaster risk management (DRM). Using the criteria of technical feasibility, political feasibility, cost-benefit ratio, timeliness, and equity, I recommend that IMPACT Initiatives and its partners (1) prioritize DRM where it is politically feasible; (2) reallocate resources towards AA where DRM is not politically feasible and AA is technically feasible; and (3) focus on traditional response where timeliness is an overwhelming concern.","instructor":"Andrew Pennock","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"Cross-Border","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"International"},{"title":"Pathways to Success: Improving the Transparency of Student Outcomes in the Virginia Community College System","summary":"\"Also contact with Catherine Finnegan \t434-243-5419\"","instructor":"Leora Friedberg","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"State/Province","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Reducing Unnecessary Separation of Children from Domestic Abuse Survivors","summary":"In child neglect cases, unnecessary separations from non-offending parents in abusive partnerships have intensely damaging and long-lasting consequences for children.

The purpose of this project will be to assess productivity in Senegal's informal sector and determine the appropriate policy actions that can be taken to increase productivity and integrate such enterprises into the formal sector.\r\n\r\nAlexandre Fall \r\n10/17/2018 \r\nDescription of Project Proposal \r\n\tIn developing nations, the informal sector tends to play an important role in overall economic activity. The informal sector, which is often referred to as the grey economy, is the part of a country?s economy that is neither taxed nor monitored by the government. Such economic activities are not included in a country?s GDP or GNP statistics. A large informal economy can be a significant inhibitor to a country?s overall economic growth as such enterprises are typically inefficient in production and reduces the availability of governmental revenues. In Senegal, the informal economy is very large and understudied. The majority of enterprises in Senegal?s informal economy are small, local and ran by individuals from impoverished and undereducated portions of the population. The success of these enterprises is hindered by a lack of access to certain markets, bank finances, advocacy, and professional formation. \r\n\tUNACOIS Jappo is a business organization in Senegal who aims to support all enterprises within the country and increase productivity of Senegal?s economy. This organization aims to represent and support the micro-enterprises of Senegal?s informal business sector while also pushing for government reforms that with increase the formalization of such businesses. The issue that this organization is faced with is that it is not certain what policies it should institute to best help these organizations grow and gain a more important voice when dealing with the Senegalese government. The organization aims to focus of informal productivity first and then utilize such growth to generate government reform. \r\n\tThe aim of this research project would be to support UNACOIS?s mission. I plan on studying informal enterprises in Senegal and the factors that either catalyze or inhibit growth for these organizations. This will increase investigating how lacking access to certain markets, banking, advocacy, and professional formation have influenced these organizations stay away from the formal sector or pressured them into joining. These finding from my research will be used to develop a set of policy recommendations for UNACOIS Jappo in order for the organization to help enterprises in the informal economy grow and ensure that they can properly advocate for such organizations at the federal level.\"","instructor":"Kirsten Gelsdorf","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"National","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"International"},{"title":"Implementing a Broadband Network in Huntington Beach, California: Enabling Smart City Technology","summary":"In this project, I will examine the current state of broadband access in Huntington Beach, Calif., and examine different policies that would expand broadband access based on cost to the city, affordability to the consumers, equity, and broadband quality.

This makes the market unique because competitors usually have to wait for a patent to expire and then convince the FDA that their competitor drug is chemically equivalent to the branded drug. Patent expiry, however, does not always result in generic drug competitors due to small market size or low profits that do not justify the application fees and time required to apply for approval. This creates market settings where drugmakers have raised prices dramatically with no recourse from a competitor. To respond, the FDA should consider a few options: (1) the status quo, (2) fiat prices for the drugs with large price increases, and (3) a new \"economic\" pathway to approve generic drugs when companies price gouge (think Mylan's Epi Pen). Many questions remain to be answered about such a concept and no one has published an economic analysis of the concept that I have seen.

Their mission is to reduce India?s ecological footprint and increase environmental justice through systemic change by building partnerships, capacity building programming at the grassroots level, advocacy and research. Currently, they partner with informal-sector waste recyclers to advocate for more sustainable and environmentally conscious waste management strategy in New Delhi. \r\n\r\nChintan is currently working to undermine (what it perceives as) Delhi&#39;s inefficient and unsustainable waste management practices. India is currently facing a national garbage crisis and Delhi is no exception - in Prof J?s words, the city is drowning in waste. Home to over 28 million people, ~9,400 tones of garbage are generated every day. The three landfills currently servicing the city - Okhla, Bhalswa, and Ghazipur - are dangerously over capacity and could collapse at any time. For example, the Okhla landfill (which I hope to focus on) was declared exhausted in 2010 but dumping continues. To date, at 55 meters, it?s height is almost three times greater than the permissible limit. The landfills are also hugely detrimental to the environment, generating massive methane emissions and leachate that seeps into ground water and poisons the city?s water supply. They also collapse regularly and kill people who live in the surrounding neighborhoods, are extremely unsanitary and smell awful. \r\n\r\nTo address this challenge, the Delhi government has authorized building and operation of four (potentially five) Waste to Energy (WTE) plants to convert trash into energy. These plants come highly recommended by western development officials but will eliminate thousands of jobs in a sector no one has accounted for: the informal sector. Waste pickers and their children rely on waste segregation as income and entire slums and communities have formed around the landfills that are completely dependent on trash for their survival. The environmental costs of these plants are also huge as they emit massive loads of CO2. \r\n\r\nFor my APP I will consider the status quo and three alternative waste management strategies for Delhi. Chintan has asked that I conduct a ?fair? analysis of each strategy (because their official position is against WTE plants) to ensure the analysis has credibility. The alternatives (for now) are: \r\n\r\n1. Status quo: low capacity WTE centers / plans for future centers / reliance on informal sector for waste segregation\r\n2. Organize the informal sector via hyper-decentralization (Chintan strategy): organizing informal sector by increasing capacity / formalizing municipality waste segregation\r\n3.  Full implementation of Waste-to-Energy Plants: Analyze full implementation, include costs, enviro and economic impacts (human and enviro costs) \r\n4. Zero-waste model: Chintan case study at Old Delhi Railway station - basically a perfectly efficient version of status quo \r\n\r\nThe informal sector is excluded from current cost benefit analysis estimates but Chintan has collected extensive qualitative data on waste pickers? income, living conditions, health and education data. I will also consider environment effects (emissions), investment and profitability of plants (energy generated), and a lot more!","instructor":"Sebastian Tello-Trillo","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"City/Municipal","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"International"},{"title":"Conscription Updated: Modernizing the Selective Service System","summary":"Eligibility for federal grants, students loans, and other forms of financial aid is tied to successful registration with the Selective Service System.

MOT may be ordered directly at an initial commitment hearing, or it may be issues as a step-down treatment plan following a period of inpatient commitment. Although available since 1976, MOT was little used until detailed procedures for ordering, delivering, and monitoring MOT in Virginia were established in 2008, making it a relatively new option for delivering mental health services. In Virginia, MOT is ordered at rates far lower than inpatient commitment; however, there is desire among some to expand the use of MOT as evidenced through bills introduced at the 2018 Session of the Virginia General Assembly. Yet, little research on the effectiveness of MOT in improving mental health outcomes in Virginia exists. \r\n\r\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of MOT, I will conduct data analysis to determine if there is a significant difference in the amount of time between receiving a subsequent temporary detention order (TDO) for individuals who were previously ordered MOT and individuals who were previously ordered to inpatient treatment. The data used originates from the Virginia Supreme Court, which records details about civil commitment procedures for its recordkeeping and policy purposed, and was collected through the eMagistrate and CMS systems. I will receive a de-identified subset of this data from the UVA Institute of Law, Psychiatry, and Public Policy. This data set will include individual level entries with variables including age, judicial district, data and outcome of commitment hearings, and diagnosis. These variables will be used for propensity score matching. Data collection began in 2011 and entries currently exist through June 2018.\r\n\r\nFollowing completion of data analysis, I will conduct semi-structured interviews with a variety of parties who have experience receiving, administering, monitoring, or ordering MOT. Potential interviewees may be CSB employees, private providers who have administered treatment under an MOT order, recipients of MOT or their family members, and special justices. The goal of these interviews will be to gather opinions and anecdotes regarding what does or does not work about MOT under the current structure. \r\n\r\nDrawing from the results of the data analysis and interview findings, I will develop policy options to expand or improve MOT use in Virginia. These options may address a variety of topics, such as MOT legislation, the process for ordering or delivering MOT, or further informing people across the state that MOT is a viable option for providing mental health treatment. I will work with Delegate Hope and the Commitment Criteria Work Group to develop policy options and identify the most relevant criteria upon which to analyze these. Finally, I will compile my data and interview findings, policy options and analysis, recommendation, and brief implementation suggestions in a report, which will be provided to Delegate Hope and the Commitment Criteria Work Group. It is my hope that this research will provide an insightful look into the effectiveness of MOT in Virginia, and my report will provide viable policy solutions to improve and expand this treatment option so that more Virginians can receive effective mental health treatment in their communities.","instructor":"Jeanine Braithwaite","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"State/Province","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Maximizing the Share of Highly Effective Teachers in High-Poverty Schools","summary":"Targeted 40 schools were established in 2012 when DCPS rolled out their 5-year Strategic Plan called ?A Capital Commitment 2012-2017.? One of the Strategic Plan?s goals is to increase proficiency rates at of the lowest-performing schools by 40% by the 2016-2017 school year. To help fulfill the plan, DCPS created IMPACTplus. IMPACTplus awards highly effective rated teachers one-time bonuses that vary based on the school?s poverty level. Highly effective rated teachers at high poverty (Targeted 40) schools are given a $20,000 bonus, high poverty schools a $5,000 bonus, and $2,000 for teachers in low-poverty schools. The bonuses are even higher for teachers evaluated with individual added scores added to their overall IMPACT score. Now in 2018, a DCPS created a new ?Capital Commitment? with more focus on student satisfaction, graduation rates, number of students and college/career readiness. In addition, demographics of DCPS students and neighborhoods are currently changing, therefore schools that are considered high/low poverty may not be the same now. (77% of students are economically disadvantaged in school year 2017-2018).  Currently, IMPACTplus continues to provide bonuses for highly effective rated teachers. In fact, retention of highly effective teachers in targeted 40 schools is much higher than retention of highly effective teachers at low poverty/non-targeted 40 schools.

I was\r\nlooking into the eligibility requirements for Medicaid, and was shocked to find a byzantine system\r\nwhich offers Virginians 17 different pathways to qualify for Medicaid benefits. Each pathway comes\r\nwith its own set of rules, regulations, and cutoff points.\r\nWhat stood out the most to me from this research were the resource limits imposed on some\r\neligible groups. Those resource limits tended to be about $2,000 for an individual and $3,000 for a\r\nhousehold ? if an individual/family held resources in excess of this limit, they were immediately\r\nineligible for Medicaid. The definition of a ?resource? varied wildly across groups, but generally\r\nincluded savings and any property (other than a home in which an applicant resided) that could be\r\nturned into cash. I was shocked that Medicaid eligibility created such a disincentive for individuals\r\nand households to save.\r\nWhen Virginia expands Medicaid in January 2019, only two groups will still be subject to resource\r\nlimits ? Virginians who qualify as aged, and Virginians who receive Medicaid as a result of being\r\neligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Other states have begun experimenting with\r\nincreasing resource limits, and most groups currently eligible for Medicaid are exempt from resource\r\nlimits altogether.\r\nIn my APP, I plan to investigate the impact of changing Virginia?s resource limits for these two\r\ngroups ? aged Virginians and Virginians receiving SSI.

This problem is expected to worsen with Medicaid expansion in Virginia starting in January 2019.\r\n\r\nUVA School of Leadership and Public Policy\r\nStudent Capstone Project Proposal\r\nContact:\tRebecca Anderson, Manager\r\n\t\tDivision of Policy Planning and Innovation\r\n\t\tDepartment of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS)\r\n\t\t(804) 356-6830\r\n\t\tRebecca.anderson@dmas.virginiag.gov\r\n\r\nClient description\r\nThe Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS) is the state agency that administers Virginia?s medical assistance program, popularly known as ?Medicaid?, as authorized by Federal statute. Jointly funded with both federal and state dollars, Medicaid provides payment for necessary medical services to eligible persons who are unable to pay for such services. Historically, in Virginia, eligibility has been limited to very poor persons with dependent children, the aged, the blind, the disabled, pregnant women, and poor children. Under the Affordable Care Act, however, states have the option to expand eligibility for Medicaid beyond the afore-mentioned groups to adults whose income is at or below 138 percent of the poverty level. Virginia?s General Assembly voted to expand its Medicaid eligibility beginning January 2019.\r\nThe Policy Planning and Innovation division at DMAS does both short- and longer-term policy research, analysis for the agency. Our customers are agency executive leadership, who expect rapid reviews of topics and clear, actionable recommendations for policy change based on evidence. \r\nProblem definition\r\nThere are an insufficient number of Medicaid-enrolled primary care practitioners to meet the demand for services among persons enrolled in Medicaid. This problem is expected to worsen with Medicaid expansion in Virginia starting in January 2019.\r\nBackground of the problem\r\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health and Humans Services, there are 110 designated health professional shortage areas (HPSAs) in Virginia for primary care alone (HRSA, 2018). HPSAs are determined by the population to provider ratio, the percentage of the population below 100% of the Federal Poverty Level, and travel time to the nearest source of care. DMAS projects that an additional 400,000 persons will become eligible for Medicaid when expansion goes into effect in January 2019. It is hypothesized that the number of persons eligible for health care coverage of primary health care services to the number of Medicaid-enrolled primary care practitioners will increase substantially in 2019. \r\nTactics to ameliorate the problem include changes to provider reimbursement rates to attract additional providers, independent enrollment of physician's assistants as Medicaid primary providers able to bill Medicaid, clarification and loosening on limit to use of telehealth modalities in service delivery (particularly with Federally Qualified Health Centers) and expansion of school-based health services beyond special education.\r\nSpecific tasks\r\n?\tReview of available member eligibility and enrollment data, and provider enrollment data to determine scope of the problem. \r\n?\tReview of policy options to address the problem\r\n?\tCost versus benefit analysis of policy options\r\n?\tRecommendations based on the analysis\r\nData availability\r\nDMAS member eligibility and enrollment data, and provider enrollment data will be made available to the student through a DMAS data analyst that works within the Policy Planning and Innovation division. The PPI division has a dedicated data analyst that works with our policy researchers. He will be available to assist the student with data requests, searches and analysis of results.\r\nOther concerns\r\nThe topic is a complex and challenging one.

Commission staff conduct in-depth program evaluations on all areas of state government. Previous studies, and more background on JLARC, can be found on our web site.\r\nThe proposed project would be conducted for JLARC staff, not the legislative members of JLARC. The results of the project would be used primarily to help JLARC staff with a responsibility established by the General Assembly in 2018 ?to review and evaluate the agencies and programs under the Secretary of Health and Human Resources (HHR) on a continuing basis.? Specific projects under this new oversight authority have not yet been established, but Medicaid and health insurance coverage are primary areas of interest.\r\n\r\nProblem definition\r\nThe main question to address is how Virginia policymakers can most cost-effectively increase enrollment rates through the health insurance marketplace, and improve competition among private insurers.\r\nSpecific questions for the analysis are:\r\n?\tIs there a relationship between competition (particularly the number of insurers offering plans) and price or plan design in Virginia localities?\r\n?\tIs there evidence that differences in enrollment rates among uninsured individuals across states and across Virginia localities are related to price and the number of insurers? \r\n?\tWhat effect would Medicaid expansion in Virginia have on price and enrollment in the health insurance marketplace?\r\n?\tAre any states using promising strategies (e.g., tax policies, other incentives, marketing) to encourage competition and enrollment in the health insurance marketplace, and to ensure that no areas are bare? Is there any evidence of effectiveness?\r\n\r\nBackground of the problem\r\nHealth insurance exchanges established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) have been operational since 2014, but the institutional framework continues to evolve, and the number of insurers in the exchanges, the plans they offer, and prices change every year. There is also uncertainty about federal policy changes that could affect exchanges, including subsidies to individuals.\r\nVirginia has relied on the federal health exchange, rather than developing a state exchange, to enroll residents. In 2018, about 400,000 individuals in Virginia selected a health insurance plan in the marketplace, according to data compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\r\nMedicaid expansion in Virginia is planned to take effect on January 1, 2019, but details of how it will be implemented are not yet clear. A key issue is implementation of a work requirement, as envisioned by the General Assembly. \r\n\r\nSpecific tasks\r\nThe specific design and analysis approach for this project would be determined by the student(s) assigned to the project, in collaboration with their advisor and with input from JLARC staff. A key and challenging part of the project will be analyzing detailed health plan price and enrollment data, both within Virginia (across localities) and across states. The analysis should be informed by a review of the research on factors affecting competition and enrollment in the health exchanges, including the effects of Medicaid expansion on health exchanges.\r\n\r\nData availability\r\nDetailed pricing data for health plans offered through the federal marketplace are available from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS); link to public use files. The analogous data for states with their own exchanges are available through CMS here.\r\nDetailed enrollment data are available from CMS; link.\r\nOther data sources are likely to be useful also.\r\nOther concerns\r\nAny geographic comparison of prices should account for differences in affordability because, for example, a $400 monthly premium is much less affordable in southwest Virginia than in northern Virginia.\r\nIdeally, the analysis will also distinguish between individuals who qualify for cost-sharing reductions because of their income, and individuals who do not qualify for cost-sharing reductions.\r\nThe analysis envisioned does not require using advanced statistical techniques, but would be best suited for a student with a strong interest in quantitative analysis.\"","instructor":"Sebastian Tello-Trillo","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"State/Province","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Is Lack of Transportation Keeping Low-Income People from Getting Food?","summary":"People experiencing food insecurity in Charlottesville may not be able to access available food at Loaves &amp; Fishes Food Pantry because they cannot get to the pantry.\r\n\r\nBatten APP Proposal Application Client description: Loaves &amp; Fishes Food Pantry, Inc. provides free groceries -- fresh produce and baked goods, frozen meats, and non-perishables -- to help people in need in the greater Charlottesville area feed their families. More than 17% of Charlottesville residents must choose between paying for housing, utilities, transportation, medicine - or food to feed their family. With food from the Blue Ridge Area Food Bank and many local grocers, Loaves &amp; Fishes gave out 2.3 million pounds of food (an average of 40 pounds--or 11 days of food--per person per visit) to 59,082 people (averaging 1,467 families/month) in 2017. Loaves &amp; Fishes? client choice model allows pantry visitors to shop for the foods their families will eat, allowing clients to select the best foods for dietary restrictions and adding dignity to the process of seeking aid.  Loaves &amp; Fishes is open Tuesday and Thursday from 6:30-8:30 pm, Wednesday from 2:00-4:00 pm, and Saturday from 10:00 am?12:00 pm. Loaves &amp; Fishes? four full-time and three part-time staff rely on an average of 671 volunteers each month to pick up, sort, re-stock, and distribute food eight hours each week and pack and deliver food to 135 households/month; in 2017, more than 900 volunteers provided 19,010 hours of volunteer labor, the equivalent of nine full time employees.  Loaves &amp; Fishes? mission is to give food with kindness and compassion to those seeking assistance while providing an opportunity for volunteers to serve their neighbors in Charlottesville and surrounding communities.  Loaves &amp; Fishes? vision is to be a best practices food pantry that proactively develops partnerships and resources, providing sustainability and vision for the future. To accomplish our mission and vision, Loaves &amp; Fishes has developed partnerships with and crosspromotion of other community social services agencies/nonprofits, including the Blue Ridge Area Food Bank, Feeding Greene, the Emergency Food Network, and the Food Justice Network; Dept. of Social Services, The Haven, the Salvation Army, Shelter for Help in Emergency, Region 10, Thomas Jefferson Area United Way, Love INC; and the Charlottesville Free Clinic, Sentara Starr Hill Health Center, UVa Student Health, UVa Hospital, and many others. A Community Awareness grant from the Charlottesville Radio Group that gave Loaves &amp; Fishes free radio advertising from August 2017-July 2018 greatly increased visibility of the pantry?s services to potential clients, volunteers, and supporters, and we are working to create a short video to use on our website, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram sites, and possibly to do TV advertising. Loaves &amp; Fishes has diversified our funding sources by developing a corporate support program and asking regular volunteers to also support financially and are working to develop a database of additional food sources to increase fresh produce, eggs, and dairy for our clients. Problem definition: People experiencing food insecurity in Charlottesville may not be able to access available food at Loaves &amp; Fishes Food Pantry because they cannot get to the pantry.  Background of the problem: From 2012 until mid-2014, Loaves &amp; Fishes Food Pantry was located on Greenbrier Drive, near a bus stop, Route 29, and two lower-cost housing complexes and before that (2004-2012), at Jackson-Via Elementary School. Since moving to our permanent home at 2050 Lambs Road in August 2015, the number of households we serve has decreased by seven percent, and we suspect families we no longer serve cannot get to Loaves &amp; Fishes. The closest public bus stop is ½ mile from Loaves &amp; Fishes (Route 5, which stops at the intersection of Georgetown and Hydraulic Roads) and can only be reached by walking up Lambs Road, a hill with no sidewalk or shoulder. Loaves &amp; Fishes is \r\ngiving out an average of 40 pounds of groceries per person, per visit, and transporting that amount of food to the bus stop is difficult for a healthy person, and many of Loaves &amp; Fishes? clients suffer from chronic disease or are disabled. People who experience food insecurity in the greater Charlottesville community often spend much of their available resources providing shelter for themselves and their family. Medical expenses and food needs can go unmet when money is tight and owning a vehicle might be a luxury. Loaves &amp; Fishes is aware that there are people who need our food who are unable to get to the pantry, and in fact delivers to 135 households each month, but expanding the delivery program isn?t the best option, as recipients aren?t able to choose the food they receive the way they would be able to do if they can come to the pantry.  We have been exploring several options for increasing access to the food we offer.  In May 2017, Loaves &amp; Fishes Executive Director Jane Colony Mills met at the pantry with the Director of Charlottesville Transit Service, Albemarle Co. Transportation Dept., County Supervisor Diantha McKeel, and JAUNT to discuss the availability of public transport and the possibility of adding or moving a bus stop closer to the pantry. While to date, there has been no change in the bus line, we are hopeful that eventually, the #5 CATS bus stop will be moved across Hydraulic at Whitewood Rd. and that a sidewalk will be added to Lambs Road. In the meantime, we have been meeting with churches near low-income neighborhoods to see if they can bring their neighbors in church vehicles to get food. Specific tasks: A Batten MPP student could help Loaves &amp; Fishes? Executive Director conduct a comprehensive evaluation of what barriers are keeping people from getting free food at the pantry and develop a proposal with several options for removing those barriers. Specific activities would include: 1) developing a survey to determine which current Loaves &amp; Fishes clients have difficulty getting to the pantry when they need food; 2) gathering information from social services case workers and other social services agencies to determine which of their clients who need food assistance do not have transportation; 3) interviewing Loaves &amp; Fishes delivery clients to determine if they can come to the pantry; 4) participating in follow-up meetings with Charlottesville Area Transit and Albemarle Co. Transportation about the status of moving a public bus stop to the intersection of Hydraulic and Whitewood roads and building a sidewalk down Lambs Road and determining why the CAT and JAUNT buses have policies to limit the amount of food a Loaves &amp; Fishes client can bring on board; and 5) researching additional area churches near low-income neighborhoods that own vehicles in which they would be willing to transport families to get food. Data availability: Loaves &amp; Fishes uses data from Feeding America to validate need in our community and has data on people we serve from our pantry. Other concerns:   Loaves &amp; Fishes recently started using the online Link2Feed client intake portal as our client registration database and is discovering that food need in our area is greater than we were aware. As a pantry that gives out two different USDA food programs and quite a lot of food each month, we still are seeing clients who are coming to our pantry or another pantry more than once each month. While they should only be able to get USDA one time each month, some clients don?t seem to have any other source of food, and often, no income, either.","instructor":"Sebastian Tello-Trillo","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"City/Municipal","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Sexual assault prevention programs for teens resettled in the US as refugees","summary":"Sexual assault prevention programs for teens resettled in the US as refugees\r\n\r\nClient description\r\nThe mission of the Sexual Assault Resource Agency (SARA) is to eliminate sexual violence and its impact by providing education, advocacy, and support to women, men, and children. Our vision is a community free from sexual violence. Our staff of 13 on-site staff, along with our weekend Emergency Advocates, provides trauma-informed advocacy and therapy for hundreds of survivors of sexual assault each year, along with accompaniment to the emergency room, a 24-hour hotline, and prevention programming for Charlottesville, Albemarle, Louisa, Greene, Nelson, and Fluvanna.\r\n\r\nThe program presently seeking support is our Prevention Program. Implemented by a small staff of three, our Prevention Program has reached nearly 16,000 people in the past 2 years. These are primarily high school and middle school students, receiving multi-session curricula in classrooms. However, this also includes teacher training, at-risk group education, peer activist groups, fatherhood groups in the local jail, workshops at churches, consulting with community-based institutions, and a range of other services. More information can be found at http://saracville.org .\r\n\r\nProblem definition\r\nWe are beginning a process of review that focuses on populations that lack access to our services. One under-served population is refugees in our service area. \r\n\r\nOur question is: What are the best practices when providing sexual assault prevention for a refugee community ? particularly teen refugees ? in the United States? \r\n\r\nParticularly, because so many of them have already come through so much violence and trauma already in their lives, how do we provide appropriate prevention training for them? What are their particular needs, and how can we leverage their particular strengths in efforts to prevent violence in their homes and futures?\r\n\r\nThis is in addition to each group of refugees coming from extremely different cultures in various places around the world. There is also the challenge for refugee teens who are acclimating to and growing up in US culture while at the same time having parents who may want to reinforce a very different (i.e. their native) culture.\r\n\r\nBackground of the problem\r\nThis issue is relevant because we do have some contact with this community, and understand that there is a real need to incorporate refugees into our broader community-wide effort to decrease incidents of sexual assault and abuse. While we have provided one-time classroom workshops for ESL/ELL classes at one local high school, we often find that our training and resources are limiting what we can provide for students in our community who have experience as refugees.\r\n\r\nA challenge is that much of our prevention programs involve addressing the root causes of sexual assault in US culture. So when we work with pre-teens, our focus is on precursor behaviors, like sexual harassment, boundaries, and consent, which in some ways may seem too basic for some students who have experienced more severe and physical forms of violence. We do address harassment from a human rights standpoint, so it is possible that our first lesson could be delivered differently, or that there is a human rights based training that would better serve teens who already have the experience of being refugees, and the violence and trauma that often is involved in their journeys so far. Ultimately, our hope with students who arrived as refugees is to partner with them as they acclimate to US culture, and help them challenge unhealthy norms (like acceptance of sexual harassment) they may be picking up from American-born peers as they adopt more and more cultural practices in their new home. But we are looking for what the best practices are, based on what others have done to support students like ours.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility is focusing on bystanders and inviting them to connect with experiences when others intervened to help them when they were in danger, or when they have intervened for others who are in danger. In other populations we work with who have experienced a lot of trauma (group homes, juvenile detention centers), we find that these students have amazing stories about how they have protected loved ones from violence, which launches meaningful conversations about how we intervene when we are bystanders to a high-risk situation involving sexual violence.\r\n\r\nWe are aware of another organization like us providing some services through the IRC, and plan to reach out to them as well as the IRC to help identify needs and solutions.\r\n\r\nUltimately we are hoping to find best practices to help prevent sexual violence in the lives of US teen refugees.\r\n\r\nSpecific tasks\r\nWe are really hoping for a literature review, and help searching for resources that others have used effectively in other localities. A report that also outlines the range of refugee communities in our region, and suggested resources for those communities, would be very helpful. This will allow us to identify capacity issues and begin to problem-solve how to better serve our community.\r\n\r\nData availability\r\nWe are able to provide a variety of resources related to best practices when providing prevention services to US-born Americans. These may be useful to launch your research into what is best for Americans who arrived as refugees. However, it is also possible that the needs are different enough that these resources may prove to be less useful than expected.\r\n\r\nContact Information\r\nLaurie Jean Seaman, Director of Prevention\r\nprevention@saracville.org\r\n434-295-7273 x125","instructor":"Jeanine Braithwaite","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"City/Municipal","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Emergency Assistance in the Rural Monticello Area","summary":"Problem Statement: Nearly forty percent of Americans struggle to pay for at least one basic need like rent, food, or utilities.

Our three primary program goals are:  \r\n\r\n1.\tpromoting child and family health through assessments, education and improved access to care;\r\n2.\tencouraging positive parent-child interactions and child development through parent education and hands-on activities that lead to school readiness; \r\n3.\tsupporting family self-sufficiency through employment and connections to community resources. \r\n\r\nCHIP works with families during the most critical time in their children?s development and growth.  We focus on families with the greatest needs to help ensure those children have the best possible start for their lives.  Teams of CHIP nurses and family support workers meet with parents at least one to two times per month, building relationships to provide skills training and resources to empower them to meet their children's needs.  CHIP may work with families over several years, as long as needed to build the trusting relationships central to supporting real change.  \r\n\r\nProblem Definition\r\nCHIP works with 325-350 families annually, including pregnant women and parents with children age 0-6.  In 2017, about 30% of these families experienced food insecurity prior to enrollment.  While the percentage drops somewhat after enrollment, a large number of families still report that they experience food insecurity while enrolled in CHIP.  Even with case management supports and information on local food resources, families are still experiencing hunger.  What more can CHIP do?  What can the community as a whole due to better address hunger?  \r\n\r\nBackground of the Program\r\nMany CHIP families qualify for SNAP benefits (food stamps), and many access food through local food banks and other programs.  Are families using these resources and still not having their food needs met?  What are the barriers for families with babies and young children to use local programs?  Are there program and/or community policies that would reduce the number of food insecure families?\r\n\r\nSpecific Tasks\r\nWe would like research on what the barriers exist for families.  Are the percentages of food insecure families higher or lower in other communities and other family support programs?  How do other family support programs in Virginia and/or nationwide meet these needs?  Do other CHIP sites and home visiting programs around the state have the same issue, or do any have better results in decreasing food insecurity? Are the issues different for refugee and immigrant families, compared to U.S. citizens?  Are any of the barriers public or private rules that discourage access?  \r\n\r\nData Availability \r\nCHIP collects a large amount of data at program entry (including food security over the past year) and collects much of this data again after one year of enrollment in the program.  Other CHIP sites around the state collect similar data.  Our regional Blue Ridge Area Food Bank periodically does large regional surveys on food insecurity.

More than 70 percent of Americans 65 plus will need some form of LTSS.  LTSS spending in the U.S. is projected to grow from approximately $200 Billion to over $3 Trillion by 2070, more than a ten-fold increase if we do nothing (Urban Institute).\r\n\r\nBy 2030, nearly one in five Virginians are expected to be over 65 years of age (UVA Today).  Despite these sobering statistics, older Americans have a strong desire to live independent and dignified lives.  However, our LTSS system in Virginia is plagued currently by inadequate funding, coordination, and choice.  Its current design places enormous pressure on families, and leaves older adults disconnected and depressed.  Most alarming, the system is ill prepared to meet the needs of a rapidly growing older population.\r\n\r\nUnder current LTSS financing, Medicaid is the primary payor which is based upon an impoverished eligibility status.  The Medicaid Program is a jointly administered federal/state program that provides payment for necessary medical services to eligible persons who are unable to pay for such services.  Funding for the Program comes from both the federal and state governments.  The amount of federal funds for each state is determined by the average per capita income of the state as compared to other states.\r\n\r\nUnder Medicare, LTSS coverage is limited, home health services are only covered for beneficiaries who are homebound and personal care services are not covered by Medicare.

This presents an opportunity for the legislature to adjust its training opportunities to make all incoming delegates effective from their first session. There are several major barriers to legislative effectiveness in the House of Delegates today. The distribution of power in the institution is highly linked to networking ability and leadership positions, but these factors are correlated with opportunities that are more frequently presented to more senior white male delegates. The best course of action for House of Delegates to seize this opportunity to alter these institutional norms is to follow the lead of other states and implement a legislator leadership training program for all incoming delegates, which would build skills relevant to legislative effectiveness prior to their first session. This program would not only promote stronger relationships among delegates, it would increase opportunity for women and people of color to achieve success earlier in their careers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Type (if applicable):  \r\nOther Contact Method (if applicable):  \r\nInternship:  American Institutes for Research","instructor":"Andrew Pennock","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"State/Province","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Renewable Energy Development in Charlottesville, Virginia: Policy Solutions for Overcoming Market Barriers","summary":"This analysis, prepared for the Charlottesville Renewable Energy Alliance, considers potential interventions to reduce market barriers for third-party renewable developers. The 2018 Session of the General Assembly brought about sweeping changes intended to bolster renewable energy production in the Commonwealth. While Virginia?s new legislation encourages renewable energy development, the incentives in the law largely benefit the established traditional utilities in the Commonwealth. The legislation does not contain provisions that sufficiently support third-party developers of renewable energy technology, such as clean technology startups and entrepreneurs. These third-party developers, located in Charlottesville and other cities across Virginia, can offer new and innovative renewable technology solutions that help achieve the Commonwealth?s sustainability goals. Due to the substantial influence of incumbent utilities, third-party developers of clean energy technologies in Charlottesville still face market barriers to the renewable energy sector. Ultimately, this analysis recommends that the Charlottesville Renewable Energy Alliance establishes a clean technology incubator program to support third-party developers with resources and connections that will reduce barriers to the marketplace for renewable technologies. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Type (if applicable):  \r\nOther Contact Method (if applicable):  Andy Pennock\r\nInternship:  National Fish and Wildlife Foundation","instructor":"Sebastian Tello-Trillo","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"City/Municipal","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Improving Retention and Membership in Adult Volunteers","summary":"This APP project looks into ways Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville (a service organization for adults) can increase membership and retention to reach its full potential of serving the Charlottesville Community. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Type (if applicable):  \r\nOther Contact Method (if applicable):  \r\nInternship:  Federal Executive Internship","instructor":"Leora Friedberg","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"City/Municipal","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Increasing Accountability to Affected People","summary":"Data from Ground Truth Solutions reveals that affected people in Lebanon generally feel that aid organizations are not accountable to them -- they are not involved in decisions that affect them, they do not find services relevant, and they are not satisfied with current complaints mechanisms.

Children impacted by maternal incarceration in Louisiana have few opportunities for developing\r\nhealthy parent-child relationships due, in part, to geographical distances between children and female correctional facilities and limited opportunities for visitation. Maternal incarceration is associated with a myriad of negative child outcomes including a greater likelihood for entrance into the foster\r\ncare system, reduced academic achievement and potential loss of future income, increased economic insecurity, disrupted living arrangements, reduced mental and physical health, and a greater likelihood for future involvement with the criminal justice system. In many cases, maternal\r\nincarceration results in an intergenerational legacy of trauma, with little multi-system coordination surrounding how to care for the young left behind. This analysis describes the harm to children associated with maternal incarceration and provides three policy alternatives for reform at various points during maternal experience with the criminal justice system. Ultimately, this analysis recommends that the LA DCPS work to establish the two parenting sentencing alternatives.This option is estimated to result in a cost-savings of over $3.5 million over the next ten years due to the reduced use of incarceration and a smaller foster care population. This alternative most successfully promotes healthy child development by allowing mothers to receive needed programming while remaining in the community with their children. Additionally, low return to prison rates displayed by similar parenting sentencing alternative programs in Washington show this option may have significant benefits for public safety. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Type (if applicable):  \r\nOther Contact Method (if applicable):  Raymond Scheppach\r\nInternship:  Prison Fellowship","instructor":"Raymond Scheppach","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"State/Province","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Protecting Investors and Managing Risks In Initial Coin Offering Financial Cryptocurrency Markets","summary":"In the context of early stage financing, initial coin offerings (ICOs) can address issues of exclusion, opacity and coordination problems that can prevent entrepreneurs from obtaining the capital necessary to successfully grow their ventures.

Twenty-three percent of college-educated immigrants who obtained their degree abroad worked in low-skilled jobs compared to ten percent of the equivalent, native-born population (Batalova et al., 2014). The underemployment of high-skilled immigrants is highly detrimental to the wellbeing of the individuals, their families, and their communities. Associated social and monetary costs include significant losses in lifetime earnings, state and local tax revenue, job productivity, as well as negative mental and physical health outcomes. The adequate employment of these immigrants would be mutually beneficial to the individuals, their families, select occupational industries, and to the Commonwealth of Virginia as a whole. The most effective solution for reducing underemployment among foreign-born immigrants will reduce common barriers to adequate employment like an individual&#39;s poor literacy, incompatible licensing requirements, and employer bias. In this analysis, a solution?s efficacy is determined by its political feasibility for both the community and the state governments, logistical feasibility, equity implications, and the net present value of its total predicted cost.

Despite this vision for unified quality standards, child care centers and Head Start programs continue to be disproportionately lower quality, while school-based preschools compose nearly all the state?s highest rated programs on quality. In fact, in Louisiana, nearly one third of ECE programs exhibited quality that inadequately supports children?s learning and development and prepares them for success in school. \r\n\r\nTo identify and evaluate the strategies program leaders were able to employ in response to state-defined goals for improvement. I analyzed survey responses from 482 program leaders in Louisiana, linking financial data on programs? quality improvement efforts, to scores derived from the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS), a observational measure of classroom quality that is tied to the state?s quality rating system. I find that investment decisions that help prepare and support teachers?for example, coaching models like Making the Most of Classroom Interactions (MMCI), CLASS observer trainings, and ensuring teachers hold professional certification in ECE?show the greatest promise for effectively fostering quality improvement, even above and beyond other determinants of quality such as program and parish characteristics. Thus, I recommend that program leaders consider adoption of group coaching models like MMCI for its high cost-effectiveness and political feasibility. Given that MMCI has relatively high start-up costs associated with training of coaches, and that MMCI is currently not widely accessed, the Louisiana Department of Education should consider targeting resources to ensure equitable access to these effective improvement levers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Type (if applicable):  \r\nOther Contact Method (if applicable):  Daphna Bassok\r\nInternship:  n/a","instructor":"James Wyckoff","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"State/Province","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Bridging the Gap Between Asian American and Pacific Islander Student-Teacher Populations","summary":"This APP tackles the need to close the student-teacher gap for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs), There is substantive research indicating that students of color tend to perform better and have improved life outcomes when taught by a teacher of color that looks like them.

Thirteen percent of community college students nationally are single parents and 42 percent are the first to attend college. In Virginia, 15 percent are over the age of 21, while at four-year institutions this is less than one percent. The following options apply best practices from other states and seek to improve Virginia community college graduation rates:\r\n\r\n?\tLet present trends continue\r\n?\tMandatory summer internship programs\r\n?\tIncrease VSFAP funding \r\n?\tBig data intervention program to catch failing students\r\n?\tPerformance measures \r\n\r\nThese options are judged using the following criteria: cost effectiveness analysis, political feasibility, implementation, equity, and quality. \r\n\r\nI recommend letting present trends continue. Based on the cost effectiveness analysis it leads to the highest graduation rate over ten years at the lowest cost per one percent increase in graduation rates. VCCS is on the right track to improve community college graduation rates using the Guided Pathways framework, but needs to take note of the quality of community college education. This can be addressed by implementing performance measures proposed in the Virginia Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2011. These measures should distribute funding to colleges with the lowest percent change in tuition and highest post graduation salaries. Funding levels should not change for the next five years to give community colleges in Virginia a chance to adopt new budget projections and test new programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Type (if applicable):  \r\nOther Contact Method (if applicable):  Scheppach\r\nInternship:  The Institute for Environmental Negotation\"","instructor":"Raymond Scheppach","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"State/Province","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Addressing Child Malnutrition: School Health and Nutrition Interventions in Nepal","summary":"Nepali school children suffer from alarmingly high rates of malnutrition as Nepal currently ranks 11th highest out of 136 countries for stunting prevalence globally. Malnutrition is typically calculated in children under five to measure growth in early childhood. However, school-aged children whose nutritional needs were not met in early childhood continue to suffer the compounded effects of poor nutrition: low weight for age and height, micronutrient deficiencies, and related disease. Despite recognizing the high social and economic costs of undernutrition, the Government of Nepal has been unable to comprehensively address the health and nutritional needs of Nepali school children. In collaboration with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the Government of Nepal (GoN), this report examines malnutrition in Nepali school children and analyzes the design and effectiveness of various school health nutrition interventions in order to improve the provision of school-based health and nutrition services.\r\n\r\nNutrition is fundamental to human well-being, and the consequences of food insecurity for health and development range from before birth to adulthood, including adverse effects on mental health and cognitive behavior. Though child malnutrition interventions typically focus on the first 1,000 days, interventions for children under five alone are not sufficient (Hunter et al, 2017). Given that the majority of children attend primary school in Nepal, school based interventions are an efficient platform for addressing stunting and undernutrition in children. National school health policies often have multiplier effects on economic and social development because they improve health and wellbeing, increase educational attainment, and support local agriculture (Rawson, 2017). Successful school health nutrition (SHN) interventions can act as a short term social protection safety net and a long term cost effective investment in the future of Nepal.\r\n\r\nThis report analyzes a set of policy alternatives that serve to address nutritional and health needs of Nepali school children. The policy alternatives include the following: establish a menu distribution program, establish the FIT for Schools program, establish school gardens, and establish a take home ration program. The policy alternatives were evaluated according to a set of criteria, including cost, effectiveness, feasibility, and most importantly, sustainability. Ultimately, this report recommends that the World Food Programme establish school gardens as the most cost-effective, feasible, and sustainable policy to address child malnutrition in Nepal. After careful analysis, it is recommended that WFP begin this policy as a pilot project that can be scaled up nationally following successful implementation after three years.\r\n\r\nSchool gardens are a powerful nutrition education tool because through gardening, children have the opportunity to engage in small-scale agricultural practices and become responsible caretakers. In addition to providing direct nutrients, the benefits of school gardens extend to the wider community, contributing to an understanding of farming and nutrition principles among students, encouraging the development of home gardens, and developing broader life skills to maintain a healthy diet.\r\n\r\nGiven public pressure and global recognition of the need for comprehensive and multi-sectoral interventions, now is a critical time to integrate SHN into the core of the education system in Nepal through the establishment of school gardens. In order to achieve the United Nations? ambitious goal of zero hunger by 2030, Nepal must commit to these comprehensive and innovative solutions that simultaneously address both the underlying root causes of malnutrition and the immediate need to ensure that all school children receive adequate nutrition to live a healthy and balanced life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Type (if applicable):  \r\nOther Contact Method (if applicable):  \r\nInternship:  United Nations World Food Programme","instructor":"Jeanine Braithwaite","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"National","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"International"},{"title":"Advancing Water Sustainability in Crozet","summary":"Population growth in Crozet raises water demand for the town.

EIA projects that the US will become a net exporter of oil in the next decade if present trends continue, so I recommend that policymakers do not seek additional, possibly costly means of achieving this trade balance sooner.

For my client, the Chesapeake Climate Action Network (CCAN), I compared three different carbon emission policies to a business-as-usual scenario. Maryland has set the goal of reducing its carbon emissions by 40% of 2006 levels by the year 2030, but the state does not yet have policies in place to achieve that goal. I evaluated options based on their ability to lower carbon emissions, their economic implications, and their political feasibility. Because the transportation sector is the largest emitter of carbon in Maryland, I focused on the impact of a carbon policy on consumer choices made by Maryland drivers. I recommend that CCAN advocate for Maryland to expand its carbon cap-and-trade policy. Cap and trade is a way to put a price on carbon emissions. When people have to pay to pollute, they innovate ways to pollute less. Maryland?s carbon cap-and-trade program currently covers only large power plants. Maryland should expand the cap to cover carbon emissions from all fossil fuels and all electricity sold in-state. Compared to a carbon tax, this policy would achieve Maryland?s emissions goal at a lower price per ton of emissions.

These policy options will be evaluated according to four evaluative criteria: 1) Effect on the share of awards granted to WS/ED applications, 2) Political Feasibility, 3) Cost-Effectiveness, 4) How sensitive the option is to changes in cost and effect. Per these criteria, this report found that Option 2) Implement an Identity-Blind Application Evaluation process is most likely to succeed. However, recognizing that the conclusions of this report are based on results extrapolated from related experiments and other literature, rather than organizational data, this report concludes that SBIR should implement pilot programs to test the effectiveness of Options 2, 3, and 4. In the proposed program, Capital Labs would serve as the project coordinator, aggregating, analyzing, and publishing the collected data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Type (if applicable):  \r\nOther Contact Method (if applicable):  Prof. Andrew Pennock\r\nInternship:  The Center for Democracy and Technology","instructor":"James Wyckoff","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"National","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Addressing Student Loan Debt In the United States","summary":"The total amount of student loan debt outstanding in the United States is too high. Student loan\r\nborrowers collectively, more than 44 million Americans, owe more than $1.4 trillion in student\r\nloan debt. About 4.8 million students default on their loans each year, and one in every third\r\nstudent with loans drop out of college.\r\nThe rising student loan debt must be addressed because it costs the society in a variety of ways.\r\nStudent loan debts were found to delay homeownership, marriage, and saving for retirement. It\r\naffects students? parents. Defaults affect the government and taxpayers. Individuals with student\r\nloan debt were also less likely to invest, which lead to lower number of small businesses, leading\r\nto low innovation and entrepreneurship. These will have direct adverse effects on the economy at\r\nthe aggregate level, reducing GNP.\r\nCosts associated with higher education has been increasing. For a decade between 2001-02 and\r\n2011-12, annual increases in price of public four-year institutions ranged from 5.7 percent to\r\n13.3 percent. In the past five years, it increased by about 3 percent each year, still greater than\r\nthe rate of inflation. The higher education market lacks price control mechanisms in its current\r\nstate. Recently, however, various actors have been implementing plans that address these\r\nproblems.\r\nBased on recent trends, this report proposes and analyzes four policy options:\r\n1. Status quo\r\n2. Expand and encourage income share agreements\r\n3. Implement risk-sharing\r\n4. Incentivize apprenticeship program registration\r\nEach of these options are evaluated on criteria, which include cost-effectiveness, default rates,\r\nequity, political feasibility, and implementation.\r\nAfter evaluation, this report recommends that the CFPB, in coordination with the Department of\r\nEducation, to expand and encourage income share agreements. This option is project to cost\r\n$353,650.72 per student with loans prevented, helping approximately 6.4 million students from\r\nhaving to rely on loans by 2028.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Type (if applicable):  \r\nOther Contact Method (if applicable):  \r\nInternship:  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau","instructor":"Raymond Scheppach","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"National","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Listening Sessions: Helping the Richmond Office of Community Wealth Building Understand and Address Poverty","summary":"The Richmond Office of Community Wealth Building, which was established in FY 2015 to reduce poverty, started &quot;listening sessions&quot; as a core component of their community engagement initiatives in 2016.

In Germany alone, over one million Syrian, Iraqi, and Afghani refugees have requested asylum. This dramatic increase in population has placed a burden on governments throughout Europe, straining economic, social, and political systems. In this report, I will examine four options to improve the financial inclusion of refugees, which is critical to the economic and social integration of this population. I will focus my analysis on Germany, where estimates suggest that over 50% of refugees do not have access to a bank account. Experts suggest that there are both demand- and supply-side interventions that can improve financial inclusion. Demand-side interventions include those activities that encourage refugees to seek out financial services, such as language or financial literacy training. Supply-side interventions address the gap between existing products and services and the needs of refugee populations, such as acceptance of alternative forms of identification.  Ultimately, I recommend that the German government partner with N26, a digital banking startup, to subsidize accounts for all refugees. This intervention is an effective supply-side solution that closes the existing gap between products offered and refugee needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Type (if applicable):  \r\nOther Contact Method (if applicable):  \r\nInternship:  UNOCHA, Mastercard","instructor":"Jeanine Braithwaite","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"Cross-Border","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"International"},{"title":"Citizens and Soldiers: Reexamining the All-Volunteer Force","summary":"I recommend that the Army increase the size of the National Guard to 48 brigade combat teams (BCTs) and reduce the size of the active duty force to 12 BCTs.

The Governor of Rhode Island has tasked the Office of Management and Budget?s Office of Regulatory Reform (ORR) with reviewing the regulation for potential reform. To determine the best course of action for reforming R23-17-BC, this analysis considers various forms of state-level FSBC regulations, presenting three archetypes for the regulation?s reform.

In addition to inefficiency, the situation on the Columbia Pike corridor raises acute questions about equity. Columbia Pike is home to vibrant communities of racial minorities, recent immigrants, and low-income residents. Meanwhile, investment in public transit lags significantly behind peer corridors in the county, despite the fact that these communities rely disproportionately on public transit.

These major weather events cause massive outages and represent massive challenges to the reliability and resiliency of the grid. Past efforts by various stakeholders to address these concerns have proven to be ineffective, as displayed by massive statewide outages in recent years caused by damage from hurricanes. With roughly 2.3 million North Carolina electricity customers experiencing a power outage in 2018 due to severe weather episodes, the need for further action on this policy issue is clear. \r\nThis report examines five solutions to address North Carolina?s grid reliability and resiliency challenges:\r\n1.\tJoin the PJM Interconnection\r\n2.\tContinue Current Hardening Expenditures\r\n3.\tImplement a 100% RPS by 2045\r\n4.\tIncrease Hardening Expenditures \r\n5.\tSubsidize Residential Battery Storage Devices\r\nEach of the five alternatives is evaluated using five criteria: cost-effectiveness, political feasibility, environmental sustainability, ease of implementation, and administrative sustainability. \r\nThis report concludes that subsidizing the purchase of residential battery storage devices while ensuring that the current levels of hardening expenditures are continued represents the best option to address the reliability and resiliency issues facing the North Carolina electric grid.\"","instructor":"Raymond Scheppach","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"State/Province","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Reducing Chronic Absenteeism Among Homeless Students in Richmond Public Schools","summary":"This report analyzes the following problem: over one-third of homeless children in Richmond Public Schools (RPS) were chronically absent in the 2018-2019 school year.

This process is rooted in the life cycle of a coal company. First, companies apply for crediting and insurance. Because creditors and insurers face minimal risk in the bankruptcy process, they incentivize the expansion of unstable firms. Once the finances have been arranged, companies apply for permits and post reclamation bonds. A problem at this stage is that certain permitting and bonding regulatory practices like self-bonding end up undermining the mission of regulators: to protect the environment. After obtaining permits and posting bonds, companies are then allowed to mine, expected to engage in reclamation and subject to inspection. Mining is inherently destructive of the environment, yet companies often fail to reclaim the land in a timely fashion, taking advantage of using certain inspection standards to infinitely postpone fulfillment of reclamation obligations. When companies eventually file for bankruptcy protection, they can either liquidate completely, or opt to engage in corporate reorganization. If the company chooses to reorganize, this cycle repeats itself once more. They are allowed to do this because companies inflate their financial solvency and engage in practices like the creation of subsidiaries to prevent creditors from seizing assets and regulators from being able to require the cessation of operations. Additionally, many common standards in the bankruptcy court system are disadvantageous to regulatory enforcement, further complicating this issue. At a broad scale, companies engage in tactics all along the way that reduce the likelihood that the environment will be responsibly managed. This report outlines this process and presents interventions for mitigating some of these concerns. While the two options proposed, eliminating self-bonding and increased financial monitoring, have great potential due to their low costs and high levels of feasibility, a wide range of considerations and changes are necessary to prevent further environmental degradation.","instructor":"Leora Friedberg","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"National","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Evictions in Virginia","summary":"Data from Princeton University?s Eviction Lab has demonstrated that Virginia is facing an eviction crisis.

This means that one in five families have little leftover to pay for clothing, food, education, and healthcare after covering their housing expenses. City leadership are actively working to address this deficit by partnering with several affordable housing organizations in the area.

Lack of appropriate action poses serious risks to the health and well-being of future generations of Americans and is projected to cost the U.S. economy $4.57 trillion ($2018) by 2100 in a business-as-usual scenario.  Though about half of states have implemented policies and joined regional programs to drive emissions reductions in the absence of strong federal action on climate change, ultimately an effective decarbonization policy from the federal government will be necessary to prompt action from the remaining (highest-polluting) states and drive a timely and meaningful reduction in national carbon emissions. Although the literature presents several policy alternatives to the status quo, we narrow our analysis to the three most viable market-based alternatives. Each of our alternatives represents a different method of driving down emissions from the U.S. power sector through federal intervention. We evaluate each policy alternative using the criteria of political feasibility, cost effectiveness, and administrative feasibility. Based on this analysis, we recommend that Apex enacts the Climate Leadership Council?s (CLC?s) Baker-Shultz Carbon Dividends plan, an economy-wide carbon tax that returns revenues in equal amounts to every U.S. resident with a valid Social Security number. Though costly as with any decarbonization approach, this alternative represents the most cost-effective approach of all the alternatives and would drive substantial emissions reductions in the electric power sector.  Since most of the major provisions impact spending and revenues, a carbon tax also has an ability to pass through reconciliation, a procedure requiring only 51 votes to pass the Senate. Finally, it can be easily implemented by the U.S. Department of Treasury (USDT).","instructor":"Raymond Scheppach","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"National","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Building Relationships, Promoting Peace: Recommendations for Scaling Up Locally-Led Solutions to Violence in South Sudan","summary":"\"Beginning with Mahatma Gandhi?s peaceful Shanti Sena to the United Nations? first ?observer?\r\npeacekeeping interventions, the presence of a nonviolent, voluntary civilian peacekeeping\r\nforce has proven powerful for reducing the consequences of violent conflict on unarmed\r\ncivilians.

In a 2017 survey conducted by FSD Kenya, 12.5 percent of digital credit borrowers reported that they had defaulted on a loan (Gubbins and Totolo, 2018). The Central Bank of Kenya reported that the 2017 non-performing loan (NPL) rate for digital borrowers was 11.4 percent compared to 9.7 percent for all loans (Financial Sector Regulators Forum, 2018). A substantial portion of digital NPLs can be attributed to relatively new borrowers and to loan values of $10 or less. An analysis of data from TransUnion, one Kenya?s three Credit Reference Bureaus (CRBs), found that one third of first-time borrowers defaulted on their loan and 60 percent of defaulters had taken no more than three loans. Approximately 47 percent of NPLs were less than $10; approximately 14 percent of NPLs were less than $2 (Singh, 2018). \r\n\r\nThese numbers are concerning because borrowers who default on loans are often ?blacklisted? by CRBs, preventing them from accessing credit from banks or digital credit providers. Borrowers can only clear their name by repaying the defaulted loan and paying $22 for a clearance certificate or waiting five years until there name comes off the default list (Gubbins and Totolo, 2018). Since a substantial proportion of digital NPLs are represented by new digital credit borrowers with relatively low-value loans, it seems that many defaulters are vulnerable borrowers who may have particular difficulty in clearing their names after being blacklisted by CRBs.

The concept of school readiness entails the basic skill and knowledge possessed by children before they enter the K-12 school system. Overall, the school readiness level of children is correlated with the socio-economic statuses (SES) of their families and the preschool education they received, which includes both family education and classroom-based education. A higher level of school readiness improves the academic outcome and future development of children. \r\nThe school readiness level of children in the city of Richmond is low, compared to the state average level. According to the fall 2019 Virginia Kindergarten Readiness Program (VKRP) report, only 41.2% of children in Richmond are school-ready, lower than the state average of 56.2%. This can be attributed to two factors: most children in Richmond are economically disadvantaged, and the existing preschool program has limited coverage and quality. The Richmond Public Schools (RPS) is the provider of public preschool education in the city. Improving the preschool program at RPS not only enhances the school readiness of its students, but also the long-term educational outcome for students after they entered the public school system. \r\nEnhancing preschool education is a complex combination of human, financial, and logistic resources to achieve a better outcome. It also requires necessary political and community support to move forward. After reviewing the existing literature and policy practices, the report evaluates these four following policy alternatives:\r\n?\tMaintain the current enrollment and spending level for the existing Head Start and VPI program. \r\n?\tIncreasing enrollment in the existing Virginia Preschool Initiatives (VPI) program. This alternative utilizes unused VPI slots by boosting enrollment efforts and local investments to cover more at-risk four-year-old children.\r\n?\tExpanding the preschool program to all at-risk three-year-old children. This alternative expands the existing VPI program by increasing the enrollment eligibility to all three-year-old. It effectively prolongs the school-based preschool to two years for at-risk children in Richmond. \r\n?\tProviding voluntary universal preschool for all four-year-old Richmond. This program combines different sources of funding with increased local input into providing a universal preschool experience that is open to voluntary enrollment for all four-year-old children in Richmond. \r\nAll four alternatives are analyzed under four criteria: cost-effectiveness, political feasibility, implementation capabilities, and equity. Under these criteria, the report recommends the third alternative, since it has the greatest impact on the long-term improvement of school readiness. In order to implement the policy alternative, the first step is to conduct a more detailed capability study for existing preschool facilities. The city council and the school board can then collaborate in planning for facility and personnel expansion. Meanwhile, RPS can further integrate the administration of different existing programs and work with local partners in discovering diverse delivery options.\"","instructor":"Raymond Scheppach","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"City/Municipal","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Reducing the Cost of Incarceration in New York State","summary":"The New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision spends about $3.3 billion annually to operate the state?s prisons and correctional services.

The large number of migrants arriving at the U.S. southern border from the Northern Triangle poses both a humanitarian and security challenge to the United States and Mexico. The Biden administration is currently experiencing the biggest surge on the border in twenty years, and as many as 2 million migrants will have traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border by the end of this year (Parker et al., 2021). The U.S. government must do more to protect the human rights of migrants fleeing from threats such as gang violence and poverty. The Biden administration has the opportunity to build an asylum system that values the humanity of all individuals.\r\n\r\nThe policy options reviewed in this report aim to identify and revise policies that cause the greatest trauma to migrants, either through denying migrants asylum or through forcing migrants to wait in dangerous, uncertain conditions while moving through the process. The Biden administration has promised to deliver a more compassionate immigration policy that reinforces American principles, such as justice and equality of opportunity. Under a Democratic administration and Congress, momentum for addressing the most damaging features of the United States? asylum process may be greater than in recent years. Policy options considered throughout this report include ending prolonged detention through expanding use of alternatives to detention; restructuring the credible fear interview and ending expedited removal; eliminating Title 42 asylum restrictions; processing MPP migrants removed in absentia; and eliminating asylum case backlogs and immigration court biases.\r\n\r\nUpon analyzing these options against the criteria of asylum seeker well-being, viability, cost effectiveness, and consistency with American values, this report recommends repealing Title 42 restrictions and establishing the public health infrastructure needed to process asylum seekers efficiently and safely. This option would ensure that all migrants eligible for asylum have the opportunity to receive their day in court, removing the largest barrier to those currently seeking protection. In order to minimize public health risks to opening our borders, this option suggests that the Department of Homeland Security expand Covid testing capacity for migrants. Potential challenges to implementation could include establishing the testing and quarantine space capacity needed to begin processing large numbers of migrants; decreasing the risk of further surges at the border; and addressing political pushback from conservative state and local government officials. \r\n\r\nFinally, it is important to note that many of the policy options considered throughout this report would work best when implemented as complements to each other. Due to the interconnected nature of asylum processes such as credible fear interviews, detention, and immigration court proceedings, implementing multiple reforms at once could augment the asylum process for migrants seeking protection.\"","instructor":"Brad Carson","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"Cross-Border","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"International"},{"title":"Elevating Materials: Increasing Teacher Selection of High-Quality Instructional Materials","summary":"My APP sought to help teachers make better non-textbook instructional material selection decisions.

There are several options squadron leadership could pursue to alleviate this issue. They could attempt to incorporate dedicated crew chiefs from the 1st Aircraft Maintenance Squadron into low-skilled low-observable maintenance tasks, pursue the creation of e-learning content to alleviate some of the on-the-job training burden on the more experienced personnel, or they could develop a stock of continually maintained exterior panels to facilitate a quick swap and return to flight.

These interventions will informed the three hospital-level alternatives I choose to examine as possible recommendations to my client, AHRQ: transitioning to capitation payment models, integrating health networks, and making EHRs patient accessible. The report concludes by recommending that the AHRQ, and HHS (the Department of Health and Human Services) as a whole, should pursue a transition to capitation payment models due to its low average cost, wide scope of effects, high viability, and moderate equity potential.","instructor":"Lucy Bassett","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"National","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Selective Service for the 21st Century","summary":"The DoD retains the Selective Service System in case a draft were needed for another major war.

Literacy skills are important because better life outcomes, financial outcomes, and health outcomes are linked to literacy. Some of the factors that exacerbate these low literacy rates include poverty, parents? lack of education, migration from Northern Ghana to Southern Ghana for more opportunities, child marriage/gender expectations, and low government presence in the region. After thorough evaluation, I recommend a two-prong solution to increase access to school for girls and to ensure they are learning the necessary literacy skills in the classroom. The first part of the recommendation is free and disposable menstrual products (alternative 1), and the second part includes expansion of teacher literacy and educational skills (alternative 3).

These policies include exploring a permanent emergency rental assistance program, universal housing choice vouchers, and a universal basic income. \r\n\r\nEven with the help of COVID-19 legislation, over 8 million US renters are behind on rent, and more than 15 million US renters aren't sure if they can make next month's rent. Ideally, Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) would keep these renters safely housed, but due to administrative and implementation issues, ERA has yet to reach millions of households. Furthermore, housing choice vouchers were created to reduce the housing cost-burden for low-income households, but only 1 in 4 Americans who have applied for this assistance actually receive it. Universal Basic Income has become popular within the political sphere as of late, and many policymakers believe that this cash assistance program will help many issues for Americans, including affordable housing.  \r\n\r\nThis report recommends making Housing Choice Vouchers (HCV) available to everyone who needs them. The program's  ability to reduce the housing cost-burden for families, increase a child's potential earnings by allowing families to move to lower-poverty neighborhoods, and potential to decrease homelessness makes this policy the best alternative for reducing housing instability across the country.  Universal vouchers may not have been in the President?s fiscal year (FY) 2023 budget request, but they were in his campaign, meaning that there?s a possibility he could pursue this program more vigorously in the future.

This APP reviewed the background of the problem, reviewed the energy sector emissions portfolios of both states, the potential damages present, the governance structure of both states, and finally, the evidence for potential solutions. The report established criteria of cost-effectiveness, equity, political feasibility, and implementation ability, and analyzed three separate potentially viable alternatives to address the policy problem through those criteria.

The primary reason noted by business owners for the lack of insurance provided to employees was its cost. Policy alternatives to address this challenge include expansion of existing tax credits to businesses with between 25 and 49 employees, premium caps on coverage specific to small businesses, and allowing for self-employed individuals to fully deduct the cost of coverage. Policy options are evaluated based on the criteria of cost effectiveness, political feasibility, administrative feasibility, and equity. It is recommended that Congressman Pappas sponsor a bill alongside fellow co-chair of the Small Business Caucus, Congressman Hern (R-OK-1), to reduce the tax rate on self- employed individuals. On average, business owners would see a direct decrease in the cost of health coverage through annual savings of $837.22. Across all impacted individuals, savings exceed $18 billion annually. Overall, this option has the highest likely chance for success of both reducing the cost of coverage for small businesses while also being administratively feasible and bipartisan.","instructor":"Craig Volden","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"National","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Improving Telehealth Accessibility in Virginia","summary":"Individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP) are a subset of the American population who self-identify as speaking English ?less than well.? Language proficiency is an indicator for other social determinants of health like race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and education level. As a result, individuals with LEP are disproportionately affected in accessibility to quality healthcare in the United States. Communication and language barriers with healthcare providers hinder the ability to construct the most effective treatment plans, impact patient-provider relationships, and decrease overall patient satisfaction and quality of care that LEP patients receive. These subpar health outcomes are not specific to in-person clinical healthcare settings; telehealth (in)accessibility for individuals with LEP, especially in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, has only exacerbated previous health care trends. Therefore, this report explores telehealth accessibility issues for individuals with LEP in Virginia as too few insured individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP) use and can access telehealth services in Virginia.","instructor":"Lucy Bassett","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"State/Province","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Increasing Economic Mobility for Children in Charlottesville","summary":"In Charlottesville, your parents? income, and the neighborhood you grow up in have a large effect on your potential outcomes in life.

Stroke survivors are frequently left disabled, which creates enormous personal, familial, and societal level costs. Survivors face high direct medical costs as well as the loss of autonomy and economic output. Family members and caregivers face costs in the form of lost economic opportunity for informal care provided and the emotional toll it takes. The incidence of stroke in Virginia is higher than the national average and faces over a billion dollars in annual costs to society. \r\n\r\nTo address this burden, I recommend the state of Virginia adopt a targeted hypertension reduction program, modeled off several successful programs piloted elsewhere. Of the alternatives discussed in this paper a hypertension reduction program scored the highest aggregate score based on its effectiveness at reducing the rate of disability from stroke in Virginia, cost-effectiveness, political and implementation feasibility, and equity. \r\n\r\nA targeted hypertension reduction program is by far the most effective, cost-effective, and equitable alternative discussed, and ranked highly in political and implementation feasibility. Other alternatives focused on improving stroke treatment in the acute phase or at the systems of care level. These alternatives provide real benefits to stroke patients, but marginal gains in treatment effectiveness simply do not compare with preventing strokes outright. \r\n\r\nImplementation of a targeted hypertension reduction program requires extensive collaboration between community members and leaders, healthcare systems, and healthcare providers themselves. \r\n\r\nBased on this analysis, adoption of a targeted hypertension reduction program in Virginia has the potential to reduce overall disability from stroke in Virginia by 13.7% over a ten-year period.\"","instructor":"Raymond Scheppach","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"State/Province","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Increasing Access to the Child Tax Credit Among Non-Filers","summary":"The American Rescue Plan Act passed in March 2021 made important changes to the existing Child Tax Credit, including increasing the credit, making the credit fully refundable, and distributing advanced monthly payments of the credit.

Using this evidence, the creation and implementation of AI and ML tools that gather PAI are recommended for the IC to maintain its intelligence edge. This recommendation was evaluated against the creation of the Open Source Intelligence Agency and maintaining the OSE using constitutionality, financial cost, risk, and political and administrative feasibility as the evaluative criteria. The criteria were derived from the culture, security, policy, and legal concerns previously mentioned and discussed in further detail below. While AI/ML tools were not rated the highest in all categories relative to the other options, it did receive the highest rating regarding cost and was tied in administrative feasibility, both important criteria for obtaining appropriations from Congress.

However, extensive development over the years has led to serious marine environmental pollution problems. The clear coastal waters in the past have become turbid and even emit foul odors, a large number of marine lives has died, and serious pollution such as water blooms and red tides frequently occur.

The supply of affordable housing, especially for those in lower income-brackets, has not kept up with demand. Many factors contribute to unaffordable housing including stagnating wages, accelerating population growth, and NIMBYism. Solutions to combating unaffordable housing fall into two buckets: subsidizing housing costs or constructing additional housing. All the recommendations proposed within the analysis focus on the later approach. Policy options explored include expanding the size of the County?s Development Area, extending the length of time that units remain affordable, adoption of a Form Based Code modeled after an existing code within the County, and combining the mechanisms of rezoning and inclusionary zoning to create a mandatory incentive. All proposals are evaluated on the number of units they are projected to create (effectiveness), their Alignment with County Goals, and comparative costs to the County government. Ultimately this paper recommends extending the minimum length of affordability requirements in combination with the establishment of mandatory inclusionary zoning. Implementation of these policies will require revision to the Draft Affordable Housing Policy, support from the County Board of Supervisors, amendments to the County Code, and continuous close collaboration with other members of County planning staff. Ultimately, however, this report stresses the importance of the actions and will of the County?s Board of Supervisors in the potential success or failure of any and all affordable housing policies in Albemarle County.","instructor":"Andrew Pennock","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"City/Municipal","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Improving Literacy in New York City Public Schools","summary":"Too few children are reading proficiently by the end of fourth grade in New York City.

In Boston, some 18.9 percent of the population lives in poverty and nearly 6 percent of households lack access to affordable housing. Perhaps more striking, some 38 percent of extremely low-income (ELI) families lack affordable housing. While numerous solutions to address this gap have been tried, both in Boston and elsewhere, the problem persists. The failure of these efforts to address the issue are not due to a lack of creativity or functional models. Rather, they almost all suffer from the same problem ? a lack of municipal funding.\r\nWith the policy alternatives I discuss in this paper, I focus on that funding gap. Specifically, I address what I refer to as the central bind of municipal finance. Namely, to spend an additional dollar on any given service, a city must typically either raise an additional dollar in revenue from its populace or spend one less dollar on services elsewhere. To escape this gap, I explore four potential creative financing solutions that municipal governments can explore.

There have been no substantial, lasting national peace agreements to quell the conflict, transition into a post-conflict government, and begin reconstruction. Even more, there has been limited inclusion of Yemeni women in these national dialogues and peace processes. The Houthis and the Republic of Yemen Government currently participate in the United Nations-led Joint Declaration process to reach a nationwide ceasefire and an agreement on continued political conversations, raising the urgency of creating and implementing a strategy to include women. Women?s inclusion in peace negotiations and the post-conflict government is one critical step to ensure that the peace agreement is both comprehensive and lasting. When women are formally and meaningfully included in the peace process, the deal is more likely to hold over the following years. The agreement is also more likely to have public support, as women are seen as honest brokers. In Yemen, women have been instrumental in mediating local conflict, delivering humanitarian aid across the front lines, and advocating for their participation at the national and international levels. Bearing in mind its specific mandate and diplomatic tools, the US Embassy Yemen has the opportunity to lead international efforts for women?s inclusion in the peace process. This APP uses four criteria to evaluate each alternative: alignment with US embassy objectives, political feasibility, effectiveness, and safety and security.","instructor":"Andrew Pennock","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"National","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"International"},{"title":"Reducing Rent Burden through Inclusive Economic Growth in Richmond, VA","summary":"The Richmond region has experienced significant growth in population and jobs over the last decade, with an influx of college-educated workers. Housing costs in the City of Richmond have subsequently increased, resulting in housing instability for lower-income residents in the form of high rent burdens and displacement to surrounding areas outside of the city. The problem is that the cost of housing in the City of Richmond is too high for its low-income residents.\r\nThe problem has numerous consequences for affected households and the city, underscored by Richmond&#39;s high eviction rate. In seeking to address this problem, the Partnership for Housing Affordability is committed to embracing bold solutions. With this in consideration, the analysis assesses four policy alternatives: 1) Maintain the status quo; 2) Implement Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMR&#39;s) and expand mobility counseling; 3) Pursue an inclusive economic growth strategy with a sectoral training component; and 4) Promote rent skewing in Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) properties. The recommendation resulting from the evaluation of these alternatives is Alternative 3. Pursuing an inclusive economic growth strategy has the potential for more extensive impact to address the scale of the problem as well as the underlying cause of stagnant, low wages for a subset of the population.","instructor":"Raymond Scheppach","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"City/Municipal","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Violence at the Border: Helping Migrants and Asylum Seekers Recover from Trauma While They Await Entry to the U.S.","summary":"This report focuses on possible actions for International Justice Mission to take regarding the violence perpetuated against asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border.

A large component of this gap is derived from racial differentials in mortality risk and the impact on retirement. Lower life expectancies faced by Black workers create disadvantages for Social Security benefits, which pay out later in life and have lower levels of accrued payouts. Additionally, the national shift towards defined benefit plans has made Black and Hispanic workers less likely to accumulate enough financial resources to ensure adequate retirement security. With Social Security quickly becoming insolvent and an increasing number of Black and Hispanic retirees below the poverty line, it is crucial that policymakers address this persistent disparity in retirement security.

Harlem, New York is where the nonprofit originated. The model Harlem Lacrosse (HL) initially implemented was that a Harlem Lacrosse employee would be designated to an individual school full-time where they not only serve as a lacrosse coach after school, but a resource during the actual school day itself to monitor academic success as well as behavior. These HL resources were initially only provided at the middle school level, but a need was quickly identified to continue offering these services at the high school level with student?s inevitably transitioning out of HL?s targeted age range. Thus, they began to expand their reach to the high school level, starting at Frederick Douglass Academy High School in Harlem, NY. Similar to the middle school level, a full-time HL employee is stationed at the school monitoring progress. Even though this model has shown to be extremely effective in improving academic performance and decreasing dropout rates of its participants, the vertical pathways that students move from middle school to high school in this large urban district creates a challenge in retaining individuals from middle school to high school.\r\n\r\nIn the middle schools that Harlem Lacrosse services, there is a ?school choice? system in place that allow students to decide which high school to attend. HL has an agreement with the Harlem school district that if a pre-existing participant of Harlem Lacrosse from Frederick Douglass Academy Middle School designates Frederick Douglass Academy High School as their number one choice they will be automatically placed in that school and will be able to continue in the Harlem Lacrosse high school program. The trouble then comes in when students do not choose Frederick Douglass High School as their first choice and Harlem is not able to assist students as they start to attend other high schools. HL has committed to ?school-based? model rather than a ?community-based? model, as their studies have shown this to have a more profound impact. The high school program in New York City is the first in HL and is intended to serve as a model for other cities to begin a high school program.\r\n\r\nIn many of the other large urban cities that HL operates in, the ?school-choice? model is an obstacle to continuing to positively influence individuals that they had in their middle school programs. Due to Harlem Lacrosse?s unique model of having a privately funded employee working full-time in a public school, the question becomes from an overarching policy standpoint of what influence should these private organizations have on the ?school-choice? model and its policies? Secondly, from an HL standpoint, how should HL best navigate school selection policies as they begin new high school programs in other cities and want to make sure that they can continue to impact the students they had in middle school.","instructor":"Andrew Pennock","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"National","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Improving Early Literacy Outcomes in Richmond Public Schools","summary":"No summary available","instructor":"Lucy Bassett","client_org_type":"Unknown","problem_level":"City/Municipal","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Sending Money Home: Reducing Remittance Costs in Sub-Saharan Africa","summary":"The average cost of sending $200 to the Sub-Saharan African region is 9.3 percent, far above the global average of 6.9 percent, and three times as high as the Sustainable Development Goal target of 3 percent by 2030.

From timber to coal and natural gas, the Appalachian region has contributed its natural resources to the entire country's development, yet the region itself remains largely underdeveloped (Payne, 2016; Zipper et al., 2020). In an area where about 75% of surface land and 80% of mineral rights are owned by actors outside the region, and such land is taxed at exceedingly low rates, Appalachian communities suffer from little tax revenue to fund public facilities (Eisenberg, 2017). These ownership patterns have been associated with higher poverty rates, fewer opportunities, and suffering public works (Appalachian Land Ownership Task Force, 1993; Thomas & Kelly, 2022). The coal industry, which primarily operated on this absentee-owned land, helped keep many Appalachian communities propped up for years. However, with a boom/bust economy, employment and wages were unstable and unpredictable. Further, the coal industry has significantly declined, with West Virginia and Kentucky losing 38,000 coal jobs over the last 30 years (Eisenberg, 2017).

While low pay is a factor, research and soldier feedback highlight deeper issues such as limited flexibility, poor leadership experiences, and bureaucratic challenges. This report evaluates three policy alternatives—leadership feedback surveys, a universal free drill absence, and an expanded retention workforce—based on cost-effectiveness, administrative feasibility, and immediacy of impact. It recommends implementing the Universal Free Drill Absence policy, which allows eligible part-time soldiers one excused drill absence per year with a makeup option. This approach is low-cost, easy to implement, and expected to boost retention by approximately three percentage points, especially when paired with strong leadership communication and a broader cultural commitment to improving the soldier experience.","instructor":"Sebastian Tello Trillo","client_org_type":"Federal Government","problem_level":"State/Province","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Improving Health and Safety for College Football Players in Florida","summary":"College football players face inadequate health and safety protections due to a system dominated by the NCAA, universities, and athletic conferences that prioritize revenue and minimize labor costs. This report, supporting the College Football Players Association’s efforts in Florida, evaluates three policy alternatives: codifying health and safety standards into state law, expanding public-sector collective bargaining rights to college athletes, and implementing a sectoral co-regulation model. After assessing each based on effectiveness, cost, feasibility, and labor stability, the report recommends sectoral co-regulation as the most promising approach. This model enables all stakeholders—players, universities, and athletic associations—to collaboratively set enforceable statewide standards without labeling athletes as “employees,” making it both effective in reducing injuries and more politically feasible than the other alternatives.","instructor":"Benjamin Castleman","client_org_type":"member-led organization","problem_level":"State/Province","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Addressing Food Insecurity in Fifeville","summary":"The primary topic of this project is identifying the most effective and feasible use of 501 Cherry Avenue to address food insecurity in Charlottesville’s Fifeville neighborhood, which has been designated a food desert.

This report evaluates three policy options—a food cooperative, a community garden, and a neighborhood farmers market—based on effectiveness, cost, equity, and feasibility. After analysis, the report recommends implementing a neighborhood farmers market in the 501 Cherry Avenue building, as it would most significantly improve access to fresh foods for a large portion of residents and could operate year-round. While fundraising will be necessary, this option provides the greatest impact in reducing food insecurity in a sustainable and community-centered way.","instructor":"Alexander Bick","client_org_type":"Public Interest/Advocacy Group","problem_level":"City/Municipal","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Addressing Impaired Driving Traffic Fatalities: An analysis of evidence-based policy options for reducing impaired driving traffic fatalities in Clark County, Nevada","summary":"Impaired driving is a major public safety issue in Clark County, Nevada, accounting for nearly half of all traffic-related deaths. In response to rising fatality rates, this report—prepared for the Clark County Office of Traffic Safety—analyzes the causes of impaired driving and evaluates four evidence-based policy alternatives to reduce these preventable deaths: implementing DUI enforcement “blitzes,” proposing a dram shop law, launching joint training for law enforcement and service staff, and mandating ignition interlock devices for all impaired driving convictions. After assessing each option based on cost-effectiveness, feasibility, complexity, and speed of impact, the report recommends the implementation and public promotion of a permanent DUI blitz schedule. This strategy offers the greatest immediate impact, with the potential to prevent 100 fatalities over five years at minimal cost, while avoiding significant administrative or political obstacles.","instructor":"Sebastian Tello Trillo","client_org_type":"Local Government","problem_level":"City/Municipal","geographic_scope_of_this_applied_policy_project":"Domestic"},{"title":"Pathways to Stability: Addressing Roanoke's Homelessness Crisis","summary":"Roanoke, Virginia, has experienced a steady increase in the number of homeless individuals over the past two years.

These barriers contribute to a cycle of economic disadvantage, impeding reentry and increasing the risk of recidivism. The Fountain Fund (FF), a nonprofit microlender, seeks to address this challenge by offering low-interest loans to FII, supporting their financial independence and social reintegration. However, only 60% of FF loans are fully repaid, compared to 90% or higher reported by other microlenders. The recommended strategy of this report is to implement a structured client check-in system, prioritizing in-person meetings early in the lending process, followed by periodic remote check-ins. This balanced approach maximizes engagement while minimizing burdens to client partners, ultimately leading to improved financial outcomes and greater sustainability for the Fountain Fund. By redefining its client partner support practices, the Fountain Fund can better meet the needs of FII, empowering them to break cycles of poverty and contribute positively to their communities.

The division plays a critical role in mitigating Munich's housing crisis by enforcing regulations that combat vacancy and restrict short-term rentals. However, internal challenges have significantly weakened its ability to fulfill its mission. High turnover, unfilled vacancies, and increased workloads have reduced the division's operational capacity. These staffing issues are not merely administrative concerns—they directly hinder the city's efforts to ensure that affordable housing remains available to its residents. The urgent need for reform is underscored by the city's worsening housing crisis, which includes growing waitlists for social housing and a steady rise in homelessness. To address this need, this report recommends restructuring the division to increase employee responsibility and flatten hierarchical layers.

Over 120,000 publicly supported affordable rental homes exist across the Commonwealth, 69% of which are funded through the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. However, LIHTC units are not permanently affordable, and almost 5,000 LIHTC units face affordability expiration within five years. Thousands of low-income renters are at risk of displacement due to rent increases or property redevelopment when affordability restrictions expire. Supporting these renters through targeted policy interventions is essential for helping these Virginians avoid the harmful effects of housing instability and homelessness. Ultimately, the recommended policy is the LIHTC Displacement Assistance Fund, which provides the most comprehensive, equitable, and effective intervention for displaced tenants. Without targeted state action, the expiration of LIHTC affordability protections will threaten housing security for thousands of Virginians. The LIHTC Displacement Assistance Fund offers a scalable, equitable policy to strengthen the state's affordable housing system and support affected tenants during this critical transition.
